Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday .
But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan .
China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .
Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .
The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time .
Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria .
Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .
It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes .
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .
Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence .
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did .
Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us .
The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . '
'
Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here .
Hosts UAE play Kuwait and South Korea take on Indonesia on Saturday in Group A matches .
All four teams are level with one point each from one game .
RUGBY UNION - CUTTITTA BACK FOR ITALY AFTER A YEAR .
ROME 1996-12-06
Italy recalled Marcello Cuttitta
on Friday for their friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection .
Cuttitta , who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month .
Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi , who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team .
Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup , where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages .
Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback .
" He ended the World Cup on the wrong note , " Coste said .
" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available .
I think now is the right time for him to return . "
Squad : Javier Pertile , Paolo Vaccari , Marcello Cuttitta , Ivan Francescato , Leandro Manteri , Diego Dominguez , Francesco Mazzariol , Alessandro Troncon , Orazio Arancio , Andrea Sgorlon , Massimo Giovanelli , Carlo Checchinato , Walter Cristofoletto , Franco Properzi Curti , Carlo Orlandi , Massimo Cuttitta , Giambatista Croci , Gianluca Guidi , Nicola Mazzucato , Alessandro Moscardi , Andrea Castellani .
SOCCER - LATE GOALS GIVE JAPAN WIN OVER SYRIA .
AL-AIN , United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06
Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday .
Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body .
It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes .
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .
Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute .
Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal .
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute .
A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot .
Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .
Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute .
Japan : 19 - Kenichi Shimokawa , 2 - Hiroshige Yanagimoto , 3 - Naoki Soma , 4 - Masami Ihara , 5 - Norio Omura , 6 - Motohiro Yamaguchi , 8 - Masakiyo Maezono ( 7 - Yasuto Honda 71 ) , 9 - Takuya Takagi , 10 - Hiroshi Nanami , 11 - Kazuyoshi Miura , 15 - Hiroaki Morishima ( 14 - Masayuki Okano 75 ) .
Syria : 24 - Salem Bitar , 3 - Bachar Srour ; 4 - Hassan Abbas , 5 - Tarek Jabban , 6 - Ammar Awad ( 9 - Louay Taleb 69 ) , 8 - Nihad al-Boushi , 10 - Mohammed Afash , 12 - Ali Dib , 13 - Abdul Latif Helou ( 17 - Ammar Rihawiy 46 ) , 14 - Khaled Zaher ; 16 - Nader Jokhadar .

SOCCER - BLINKER BAN LIFTED .
LONDON 1996-12-06
Dutch forward Reggie Blinker had his indefinite suspension lifted by FIFA on Friday and was set to make his Sheffield Wednesday comeback against Liverpool on Saturday .
Blinker missed his club 's last two games after FIFA slapped a worldwide ban on him for appearing to sign contracts for both Wednesday and Udinese while he was playing for Feyenoord .
FIFA 's players ' status committee , meeting in Barcelona , decided that although the Udinese document was basically valid , it could not be legally protected .
The committee said the Italian club had violated regulations by failing to inform Feyenoord , with whom the player was under contract .
Blinker was fined 75,000 Swiss francs ( $ 57,600 ) for failing to inform the Engllsh club of his previous commitment to Udinese .
SOCCER - LEEDS ' BOWYER FINED FOR PART IN FAST-FOOD FRACAS .
LONDON 1996-12-06
Leeds ' England under-21 striker Lee Bowyer was fined 4,500 pounds ( $ 7,400 ) on Friday for hurling chairs at restaurant staff during a disturbance at a McDonald 's fast-food restaurant .
Bowyer , 19 , who was caught in the act by security cameras , pleaded guilty to a charge of affray at a court in London .
He was fined and ordered to pay a total of 175 pounds to two members of staff injured in the fracas in an east London restaurant in October .
Leeds had already fined Bowyer 4,000 pounds ( $ 6,600 ) and warned him a repeat of his criminal behaviour could cost him his place in the side .
Bowyer , who moved to the Yorkshire club in August for 3.5 million pounds ( $ 5.8 million ) , was expected to play against Middlesbrough on Saturday .

RUGBY UNION - LITTLE TO MISS CAMPESE FAREWELL .
Robert Kitson
LONDON 1996-12-06
Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday .
Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert .
Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu .
The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours .
The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic .
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town .
" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance .
On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , Ireland and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .
League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt .
Teams :
Barbarians - 15 - Tim Stimpson ( England ) ; 14 - Nigel Walker ( Wales ) , 13 - Allan Bateman ( Wales ) , 12 - Gregor Townsend ( Scotland ) , 11 - Tony Underwood ( England ) ; 10 - Rob Andrew ( England ) , 9 - Rob Howley ( Wales ) ; 8 - Scott Quinnell ( Wales ) , 7 - Neil Back ( England ) , 6 - Dale McIntosh ( Pontypridd ) , 5 - Ian Jones ( New Zealand ) , 4 - Craig Quinnell ( Wales ) , 3 - Darren Garforth ( Leicester ) , 2 - Norm Hewitt ( New Zealand ) , 1 - Nick Popplewell ( Ireland ) .
Australia - 15 - Matthew Burke ; 14 - Joe Roff , 13 - Daniel Herbert , 12 - Tim Horan ( captain ) , 11 - David Campese ; 10 - Pat Howard , 9 - Sam Payne ; 8 - Michael Brial , 7 - David Wilson , 6 - Owen Finegan , 5 - David Giffin , 4 - Tim Gavin , 3 - Andrew Blades , 2 - Marco Caputo , 1 - Dan Crowley .

SOCCER - UNCAPPED PLAYERS CALLED TO FACE MACEDONIA .
BUCHAREST 1996-12-06
Romania trainer Anghel Iordanescu called up three uncapped players on Friday in his squad to face Macedonia next week in a World Cup qualifier .
Midfielder Valentin Stefan and striker Viorel Ion of Otelul Galati and defender Liviu Ciobotariu of National Bucharest are the newcomers for the European group eight clash in Macedonia on December 14 .
Iordanescu said he had picked them because of their good performances in the domestic championship in which National Bucharest are top and Otelul Galati third . "
I think it 's fair to give them a chance , " he told reporters .
League title-holders Steaua Bucharest , who finished bottom of their Champions ' League group in the European Cup , have only two players in the squad .
Attacking midfielder Adrian Ilie , who recently moved from Steaua to Turkish club Galatasaray , is ruled out after two yellow-card offences .
Squad :
Goalkeepers - Bogdan Stelea , Florin Prunea .
Defenders - Dan Petrescu , Daniel Prodan , Anton Dobos , Cornel Papura , Liviu Ciobotariu , Tibor Selymess , Iulian Filipescu .
Midfielders - Gheorghe Hagi , Gheorghe Popescu , Constantin Galca , Valentin Stefan , Basarab Panduru , Dorinel Munteanu , Ovidiu Stinga .
Forwards - Ioan Vladoiu , Gheorghe Craioveanu , Ionel Danciulescu , Viorel Ion .

CRICKET - LARA ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY .
Robert Galvin
MELBOURNE 1996-12-06
Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday .
Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .
Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .
All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .
Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .
His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .
Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .
West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday .
He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .
The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle .
It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .
Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .
Pakistan , who arrive in Australia later this month , are the other team competing in the World Series tournament .

CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY .
MELBOURNE 1996-12-06
West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday .
Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .
The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket .
West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat .
Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him .
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .
On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .
Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday .
Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take .
Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper .
Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings .
Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago .
Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected .
Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament .

The Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) has previously been mapped to the proximal short arm of the X chromosome between the DXS14 and DXS7 loci .
In this study , further segregation analysis has been performed using a newly identified WAS family as well as an additional marker probe , HOATL1 .
The results indicate close linkage between the WAS and OATL1 loci ( Z = 6 . 08 at theta = 0 . 00 ) and localize the TIMP , OATL1 , DXS255 , and WAS loci distal to DXS146 and the OATL1 and WAS loci proximal to TIMP .
These linkage data narrow the boundaries within which the WAS locus maps to the chromosomal region bracketed by TIMP and DXS146 and support the loci order Xpter - DXS7 - TIMP - ( OATL1 , WAS , DXS255 ) - DXS146 .
Detection of an unstable fragment of DNA specific to individuals with myotonic dystrophy .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , with a prevalence of 2 - 14 per 100 , 000 individuals .
The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sustained muscle contraction , often with a wide range of accompanying symptoms .
The age at onset and severity of the disease show extreme variation , both within and between families .
Despite its clinical variability , this dominant condition segregates as a single locus at chromosome 19q13 .
3 in every population studied .
It is flanked by the tightly linked genetic markers ERCC1 proximally and D19S51 distally ; these define the DM critical region .
We report the isolation of an expressed sequence from this region which detects a DNA fragment that is larger in affected individuals than in normal siblings or unaffected controls .
The size of this fragment varies between affected siblings , and increases in size through generations in parallel with increasing severity of the disease .
We postulate that this unstable DNA sequence is the molecular feature that underlies DM .
Common sequence motifs at the rearrangement sites of a constitutional X / autosome translocation and associated deletion .
Reciprocal chromosome translocations are common de novo rearrangements that occur randomly throughout the human genome .
To learn about causative mechanisms , we have cloned and sequenced the breakpoints of a cytologically balanced constitutional reciprocal translocation , t ( X ; 4 ) ( p21 . 2 ; q31 . 22 ) , present in a girl with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) .
Physical mapping of the derivative chromosomes , after their separation in somatic cell hybrids , reveals that the translocation disrupts the DMD gene in Xp21 within the 18 - kb intron 16 .
Restriction mapping and sequencing of clones that span both translocation breakpoints as well as the corresponding normal regions indicate the loss of approximately 5 kb in the formation of the derivative X chromosome , with 4 - 6 bp deleted from chromosome 4 .
RFLP and Southern analyses indicate that the de novo translocation is a paternal origin and that the fathers X chromosome contains the DNA that is deleted in the derivative X .
Most likely , deletion and translation arose simultaneously from a complex rearrangement event that involves three chromosomal breakpoints .
Short regions of sequence homology were present at the three sites .
A 5 - bp sequence , GGAAT , found exactly at the translocation breakpoints on both normal chromosomes X and 4 , has been preserved only on the der ( 4 ) chromosome .
It is likely that the X - derived sequence GGAATCA has been lost in the formation of the der ( X ) chromosome , as it matches an inverted GAATCA sequence present on the opposite strand exactly at the other end of the deleted 5 - kb fragment .
A genetic etiology for DiGeorge syndrome : consistent deletions and microdeletions of 22q11 .
DiGeorge syndrome ( DGS ) , a developmental field defect of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches , is characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands and by conotruncal cardiac malformations .
Cytogenetic studies support the presence of a DGS critical region in band 22q11 .
In the present study , we report the results of clinical , cytogenetic , and molecular studies of 14 patients with DGS .
Chromosome analysis , utilizing high - resolution banding techniques , detected interstitial deletions in five probands and was inconclusive for a deletion in three probands .
The remaining six patients had normal karyotypes .
In contrast , molecular analysis detected DNA deletions in all 14 probands .
Two of 10 loci tested , D22S75 and D22S259 , are deleted in all 14 patients .
A third locus , D22S66 , is deleted in the eight DGS probands tested .
Physical mapping using somatic cell hybrids places D22S66 between D22S75 and D22S259 , suggesting that it should be deleted in the remaining six cases .
Parent - of - origin studies were performed in five families .
Four probands failed to inherit a maternal allele , and one failed to inherit a paternal allele .
On the basis of these families , and of six maternally and five paternally derived unbalanced - translocation DGS probands in the literature , parent of origin or imprinting does not appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DGS .
Deletion of the same three loci in all 14 DGS probands begins to delineate the region of chromosome 22 critical for DGS and confirms the hypothesis that submicroscopic deletions of 22q11 are etiologic in the vast majority of cases . .
Loss of normal allele of the APC gene in an adrenocortical carcinoma from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis .
Endocrine neoplasms have been reported occasionally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .
An adrenocorotical carcinoma was studied in a patient with a family history of FAP .
Loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) in the region close to the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene was detected in this carcinoma , and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the APC gene .
This is the first demonstration of LOH at the APC locus in adrenocortical tumors .
The present results and our previous data on LOH in a recurring desmoid tumor suggest that the heterozygous mutant / wild - type condition of the APC gene may give rise to benign tumors , and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of tumors not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in FAP patients . .
Oncogenic point mutations in exon 20 of the RB1 gene in families showing incomplete penetrance and mild expression of the retinoblastoma phenotype .
The retinoblastoma - predisposition gene , RB1 , segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with high ( 90 % ) penetrance .
Certain families , however , show an unusual low - penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected , unilaterally affected , or with evidence of spontaneously regressed tumors .
We have used single - strand conformation polymorphism analysis and PCR sequencing to study two such families .
Mutations were found in exon 20 of RB1 in both cases .
In one family a C - - - - T transition in codon 661 converts an arginine ( CGG ) to a tryptophan ( TGG ) codon .
In this family , incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were observed in virtually all patients , possibly indicating that single amino acid changes may modify protein structure / function such that tumorigenesis is not inevitable .
In the second family the mutation in codon 675 is a G - - - - T transversion that converts a glutamine ( GAA ) to a stop ( TAA ) codon .
However , this mutation also occurs near a potential cryptic splice acceptor site , raising the possibility of alternative splicing resulting in a less severely disrupted protein . .
Late - onset metachromatic leukodystrophy : molecular pathology in two siblings .
We report on a new allele at the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) locus causing late - onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) .
In that allele arginine84 , a residue that is highly conserved in the arylsulfatase gene family , is replaced by glutamine .
In contrast to alleles that cause early - onset MLD , the arginine84 to glutamine substitution is associated with some residual ARSA activity .
A comparison of genotypes , ARSA activities , and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele of 81 patients with MLD examined , further validates the concept that different degrees of residual ARSA activity are the basis of phenotypical variation in MLD . .
Trisomy 15 with loss of the paternal 15 as a cause of Prader - Willi syndrome due to maternal disomy .
Uniparental disomy has recently been recognized to cause human disorders , including Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .
We describe a particularly instructive case which raises important issues concerning the mechanisms producing uniparental disomy and whose evaluation provides evidence that trisomy may precede uniparental disomy in a fetus .
Chorionic villus sampling performed for advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 in all direct and cultured cells , though the fetus appeared normal .
Chromosome analysis of amniocytes obtained at 15 wk was normal in over 100 cells studied .
The child was hypotonic at birth , and high - resolution banding failed to reveal the deletion of 15q11 - 13 , a deletion which is found in 50 % - 70 % of patients with PWS .
Over time , typical features of PWS developed .
Molecular genetic analysis using probes for chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy .
Maternal nondisjunction with fertilization of a disomic egg by a normal sperm , followed by loss of the paternal 15 , is a likely cause of confined placental mosaicism and uniparental disomy in this case of PWS , and advanced maternal age may be a predisposing factor . .
Genetic heterogeneity in X - linked amelogenesis imperfecta .
The AMELX gene located at Xp22 .
1 - p22 .
3 encodes for the enamel protein amelogenin and has been implicated as the gene responsible for the inherited dental abnormality X - linked amelogenesis imperfecta ( XAI ) .
Three families with XAI have been investigated using polymorphic DNA markers flanking the position of AMELX .
Using two - point linkage analysis , linkage was established between XAI and several of these markers in two families , with a combined lod score of 6 .
05 for DXS16 at theta = 0 .
04 04 .
This supports the involvement of AMELX , located close to DXS16 , in the XAI disease process ( AIH1 ) in those families .
Using multipoint linkage analysis , the combined maximum lod score for these two families was 7 .
30 for a location of AIH1 at 2 cM distal to DXS16 .
The support interval around this location extended about 8 cM proximal to DXS92 , and the AIH1 location could not be precisely defined by multipoint mapping .
Study of recombination events indicated that AIH1 lies in the interval between DXS143 and DXS85 .
There was significant evidence against linkage to this region in the third family , indicating locus heterogeneity in XAI .
Further analysis with markers on the long arm of the X chromosome showed evidence of linkage to DXS144E and F9 with no recombination with either of these markers .
Two - point analysis gave a peak lod score at DXS144E with a maximum lod score of 2 .
83 at theta = 0 , with a peak lod score in multipoint linkage analysis of 2 .
84 at theta = 0 .
The support interval extended 9 cM proximal to DXS144E and 14 cM distal to F9 .
( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) .
Multiple origins for phenylketonuria in Europe .
Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups , is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) .
PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder , with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene .
The haplotype associations , relative frequencies , and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations ( R158Q , R261Q , IVS10nt546 , R408W , and IVS12n1 ) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles .
Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene .
These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago .
From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe , four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups .
Together , these data suggest that there were multiple , geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population . .
Complement factor 2 deficiency : a clinical and serological family study .
Inherited complement deficiencies are associated with a variety of connective tissue diseases .
A family with inherited deficiency of complement factor 2 ( C2 ) is described in which two family members with homozygous C2 deficiency developed cutaneous vasculitis and sicca syndrome .
The other family members had heterozygous C2 deficiency and each member had the HLA - A25 , B18 , DR2 ( w15 ) haplotype .
The mother had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis .
Further studies showed the presence of cryoglobulins , antibodies against endothelial cells , and anticardiolipin antibodies . .
New variant in exon 3 of the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene in a family with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease .
A C - - greater than G transversion has been found in exon 3 of the PLP gene of affected males and their mother in a single sibship with Pelizaeus - merzbacher disease ( PMD ) .
The transversion should not result in an amino acid change in the protein but it does result in the loss of a HaeIII restriction endonuclease cleavage site .
It is concordant with the disease in this family .
One - hundred - ten unrelated X chromosomes are negative for this mutation .
No other sequence defect was found in the PLP exons of the affected males .
The cause of disease in this family remains unknown , but the association between this rare mutation and PMD is intriguing .
The mutation can serve as a marker for following segregation of the PLP gene . .
Uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene .
Proteolipid protein ( PLP ; M ( r ) 30 , 000 ) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure .
Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders .
Mutations of the X - chromosome - linked PLP gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease .
The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination .
Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino - acid substitution Ile - to - Thr at residue 186 in a membrane - embedded domain of PLP .
Surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin - deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes .
Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP - dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration .
We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease . .
A pseudodeficiency allele common in non - Jewish Tay - Sachs carriers : implications for carrier screening .
Deficiency of beta - hexosaminidase A ( Hex A ) activity typically results in Tay - Sachs disease .
However , healthy subjects found to be deficient in Hex A activity ( i . e . , pseudodeficient ) by means of in vitro biochemical tests have been described .
We analyzed the HEXA gene of one pseudodeficient subject and identified both a C739 - to - T substitution that changes Arg247 - - - - Trp on one allele and a previously identified Tay - Sachs disease mutation on the second allele .
Six additional pseudodeficient subjects were found to have the C739 - to - T mutation .
This allele accounted for 32 % ( 20 / 62 ) of non - Jewish enzyme - defined Tay - Sachs disease carriers but for none of 36 Jewish enzyme - defined carriers who did not have one of three known mutations common to this group .
The C739 - to - T allele , together with a " true " Tay - Sachs disease allele , causes Hex A pseudodeficiency .
Given both the large proportion of non - Jewish carriers with this allele and that standard biochemical screening cannot differentiate between heterozygotes for the C739 - to - T mutations and Tay - Sachs disease carriers , DNA testing for this mutation in at - risk couples is essential .
Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease : detection of mutations Thr181 - - - - Pro and Leu223 - - - - Pro in the proteolipid protein gene , and prenatal diagnosis .
A family with an apparent history of X - linked Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease presented for genetic counseling , requesting carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis .
RFLP analysis using the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene probe was uninformative in this family .
A prenatal diagnosis on a chorionic villus sample ( CVS ) was carried out using single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis of a variant in exon 4 of the PLP gene .
The fetus was predicted to be unaffected .
Sequencing of the exon from the CVS , the predicted - carrier mother , and the obligate - carrier grandmother revealed an A - to - C change at nucleotide 541 in the two women but not in the fetus .
As this change results in a Thr - to - Pro change at amino acid 181 in a region of the gene predicted to be part of a transmembrane segment , it was concluded that this was the mutation causing the disease in this family .
In addition , in a second family , an exon 5 variant band pattern on SSCP analysis was shown by sequencing to be due to a T - to - C change at nucleotide 668 .
This results in a Leu - to - Pro change in a carrier mother and in her two affected sons .
These results provide further examples of mutations in PLP that cause Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease and illustrate the value of SSCP in genetic analysis . .
von Willebrand disease type B : a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin - induced von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib .
von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib .
For human vWF , this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin .
A missense mutation , Gly - 561 - - > Ser , was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B , a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin - induced , but normal botrocetin - induced , binding to glycoprotein Ib .
The corresponding mutant recombinant protein , rvWF ( G561S ) , formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vWF , confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B .
These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms .
The normal botrocetin - induced binding and the defective ristocetin - induced binding of rvWF ( G561S ) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF . .
Typical and partial cat eye syndrome : identification of the marker chromosome by FISH .
Three children are reported with typical cat eye syndrome ( CES ) and three more children with partial CES because of absence of coloboma , in which the supernumerary marker chromosome was studied by FISH .
Using a genomic library , and also a centromeric and particularly a cosmid probe of 22q11 , partial tetrasomy was shown in all cases . .
[ Genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency : mutant alleles of G6PD in the Shekii district of Azerbaijan ]
Examination on G6PD deficiency in 349 patients of Shekii district hospital ( Azerbaijan ) revealed 16 hemi - , 4 homo - and 9 heterozygotic carriers of the defect .
Gd - frequency , calculated from the data obtained ( 7 . 7 % ) , may be compared to neighbouring regions frequencies ( 6 - 30 % ) .
Carriers of G6PD deficiency are residents of 11 villages located in Alasani - Aphtalan valley , highly endemic with malaria in the past ; nearly all marriages are endogamic .
Physico - chemical and kinetic study of 10 mutant forms of G6PD , according to WHO program , led to identification of 5 variants of the II class ( Shekii , Bideiz , Shirin - Bulakh , Okhut I and Zakataly ) and 2 variants of the III class ( Okhut II and Martinique - like ) .
Resemblance of the majority of variants in electrophoretic mobility and the level of erythrocyte enzyme activity permit to suggest the existence of a common parental mutant G6PD allele distributed in this area .
Craniofrontonasal dysplasia .
We report on nine patients with craniofrontonasal dysplasia ( CFND ) .
Seven classical cases had facial features suggestive of frontonasal dysplasia and coronal craniosynostosis .
Extracranial abnormalities such as brittle nails with prominent longitudinal grooves or syndactyly of fingers and toes were observed in individual patients .
In two families the father of classical cases showed a milder pattern of abnormalities , consistent with the diagnosis .
We present a 2 - to 13 - year follow - up on our patients .
Hypotonia and laxity of joints are common and may necessitate supportive measures .
Mild developmental delay was noted in three out of six classical cases studied in detail .
Unlike almost all other X - linked disorders , clinical expression in CFND is generally much more severe in females than in males .
In contrast to previous reports of this condition , one of our severely affected cases is a male . .
The intron 7 donor splice site transition : a second Tay - Sachs disease mutation in French Canada .
Mutations at the hexosaminidase A ( HEXA ) gene which cause Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) have elevated frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish and French - Canadian populations .
We report a novel TSD allele in the French - Canadian population associated with the infantile form of the disease .
The mutation , a G - - > A transition at the + 1 position of intron 7 , abolishes the donor splice site .
Cultured human fibroblasts from a compound heterozygote for this transition ( and for a deletion mutation ) produce no detectable HEXA mRNA .
The intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs in the base adjacent to the site of the adult - onset TSD mutation ( G805A ) .
In both mutations a restriction site for the endonuclease EcoRII is abolished .
Unambiguous diagnosis , therefore , requires allele - specific oligonucleotide hybridization to distinguish between these two mutant alleles .
The intron 7 + 1 mutation has been detected in three unrelated families .
Obligate heterozygotes for the intron 7 + 1 mutation were born in the Saguenay - Lac - St - Jean region of Quebec .
The most recent ancestors common to obligate carriers of this mutation were from the Charlevoix region of the province of Quebec .
This mutation thus has a different geographic centre of diffusion and is probably less common than the exon 1 deletion TSD mutation in French Canadians .
Neither mutation has been detected in France , the ancestral homeland of French Canada . .
Assignment of the aspartylglucosaminidase gene ( AGA ) to 4q33 - - - - q35 based on decreased activity in a girl with a 46 , XX , del ( 4 ) ( q33 ) karyotype .
Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is a recessive autosomally inherited lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) .
The structural gene for this human enzyme ( AGA ) has been assigned to the region 4q21 - - - - qter .
We determined the AGA activity in cultured fibroblasts of a girl with a 46 , XX , del ( 4 ) ( q33 ) karyotype .
The results indicate that the girl is a hemizygote for AGA , permitting the assignment of human AGA to the region 4q33 - - - - qter . .
Resolution of the two loci for autosomal dominant aniridia , AN1 and AN2 , to a single locus on chromosome 11p13 .
Two distinct loci have been proposed for aniridia ; AN1 for autosomal dominant aniridia on chromosome 2p and AN2 for the aniridia in the WAGR contiguous gene syndrome on chromosome 11p13 .
In this report , the kindred segregating for autosomal dominant aniridia , which suggested linkage to acid phosphatase - 1 ( ACP1 ) and led to the assignment of the AN1 locus on chromosome 2p , has been updated and expanded .
Linkage analysis between the aniridia phenotype and ACP1 does not support the original linkage results , excluding linkage up to theta = 0 .
17 with Z = - 2 .
Tests for linkage to other chromosome 2p markers .
APOB , D2S71 , D2S5 , and D2S1 , also excluded linkage to aniridia .
Markers that have been isolated from the chromosome 11p13 region were then analyzed in this aniridia family .
Two RFLPs at the D11S323 locus give significant evidence for linkage .
The PvuII polymorphism detected by probe p5S1 .
6 detects no recombinants , with a maximum lod score of Z = 6 .
97 at theta = 0 .
00 00 .
The HaeIII polymorphism detected by the probe p5BE1 .
2 gives a maximum lod score of Z = 2 .
57 at theta = 0 .
00 00 .
Locus D11S325 gives a lod score of Z = 1 .
53 at theta = 0 .
00 00 .
These data suggest that a locus for aniridia ( AN1 ) on chromosome 2p has been misassigned and that this autosomal dominant aniridia family is segregating for an aniridia mutation linked to markers in the 11p13 region .
Fatal pyoderma gangrenosum in association with C7 deficiency .
Although pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG ) is often associated with systemic diseases , it has not been reported in association with congenital complement deficiencies .
We describe an aggressive and ultimately fatal case of PG in a patient with a congenital C7 deficiency .
Deficiencies of C7 can be associated with decreased neutrophil chemotaxis , phagocytosis , and opsonization , similar to the immunologic abnormalities described in patients with PG .
Our patients decreased complement level , if not directly related to the development of PG , may have contributed to the aggressive nature of her disease . .
Diverse point mutations result in glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) polymorphism in Taiwan .
Glucose - 6 - PHOSPHATE dehydrogenase ( G6PD ; EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 49 ) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy , affecting more than 200 million people worldwide .
Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria , little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies .
Recently , the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced , which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level .
During the past 10 years , we examined the G6PD activity in 21 , 271 newborn Chinese infants ( 11 , 400 males and 9 , 871 females ) and identified 314 ( 2 . 8 % ) males and 246 ( 2 . 5 % ) females having low G6PD activity .
The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified , subcloned , and sequenced .
Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan .
The first type of mutation ( 487 G - - - - A ) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487 , which results in a ( 163 ) Gly to Ser substitution .
The second type of mutation ( 493 A - - - - G ) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese .
This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493 , producing an ( 165 ) Asn to Asp substitution .
Interestingly , the 487 G - - - - A and 493 A - - - - G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites , respectively , which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR / restriction enzyme ( RE ) digestion method .
The third mutation ( 1376 G - - - - T ) was found in four affected Chinese .
This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an ( 459 ) Arg to Leu substitution .
The 1376 G - - - - T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan .
Finally , two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation ( 1388 G - - - - A ) .
This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an ( 463 ) Arg to His substitution .
Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR / RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G - - - - A and 493 A - - - - G mutations .
An error in dystrophin mRNA processing in golden retriever muscular dystrophy , an animal homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy .
Golden retriever muscular dystrophy ( GRMD ) is a spontaneous , X - linked , progressively fatal disease of dogs and is also a homologue of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) .
Two - thirds of DMD patients carry detectable deletions in their dystrophin gene .
The defect underlying the remaining one - third of DMD patients is undetermined .
Analysis of the canine dystrophin gene in normal and GRMD dogs has failed to demonstrate any detectable loss of exons .
Here , we have demonstrated a RNA processing error in GRMD that results from a single base change in the 3 consensus splice site of intron 6 .
The seventh exon is then skipped , which predicts a termination of the dystrophin reading frame within its N - terminal domain in exon 8 .
This is the first example of dystrophin deficiency caused by a splice - site mutation . .
Type I human complement C2 deficiency .
A 28 - base pair gene deletion causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing .
Two variants of a genetic deficiency of complement protein C2 ( C2D ) have been previously identified .
No C2 protein translation is detected in type I deficiency , while type II deficiency is characterized by a selective block in C2 secretion .
Type I C2 deficiency was described in a family in which the C2 null allele ( C2Q0 ) is associated with the major histocompatibility haplotype / complotype HLA - A25 , B18 , C2Q0 , BfS , C4A4 , C4B2 , Drw2 ; this extended haplotype occurs in over 90 % of C2 - deficient individuals ( common complotype / haplotype ) .
To determine the molecular basis of type I C2 deficiency , the C2 gene and cDNA were characterized from a homozygous type I C2 - deficient individual with the common associated haplotype / complotype .
We found a 28 - base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene , beginning 9 base pairs upstream of the 3 - end of exon 6 , that generates a C2 transcript with a complete deletion of exon 6 ( 134 base pair ) and a premature termination codon .
In studies of eight kindred , the 28 - base pair deletion was observed in all C2Q0 alleles associated with the common type I deficient complotype / haplotype ; this deletion was not present in normal C2 nor in type II C2 - deficient genes .
These data demonstrate that 1 ) type I human complement C2 deficiency is caused by a 28 - base pair genomic deletion that causes skipping of exon 6 during RNA splicing , resulting in generation of a premature termination codon , 2 ) the 28 - base pair deletion in the type I C2Q0 gene is strongly associated with the HLA haplotype / complotype A25 , B18 , C2Q0 , BfS , C4A4 , C4B2 , Drw2 , suggesting that all C2 - deficient individuals with this haplotype / complotype will harbor the 28 - base pair C2 gene deletion , and 3 ) type II C2 deficiency is caused by a different , as yet uncharacterized , molecular genetic defect . .
Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations and one polymorphism : implications for structure - function analysis of human galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyltransferase .
We report here the molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations , L74P and F171S , and one polymorphism , S135L , in human galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyltransferase ( GALT ) .
Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed .
The polymorphism , in contrast , has near normal activity .
Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues , suggesting that they are functionally important , while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function .
The F171S mutation is close to the putative active - site nucleophile .
Our data further support the notion of molecular heterogeneity of galactosemia and suggest that galactosemia mutations and GALT polymorphisms may be useful tools in highlighting different functional domains in human GALT . .
Linkage relationship of C2 deficiency , HLA and glyoxalase I loci .
Immunogenetic analysis of a homozygous C2 - deficient individual and family members demonstrated linkage of HLA - A25 , B18 and C2o .
HLA - D typing showed that 5 members typed with homozygous Dw2 typing cells from an individual with C2 deficiency but not with Dw2 typing cells from 2 individuals with normal C2 .
