The homozygous C2 - deficient propositus and brother were HLA - A and B homozygous but heterozygous at the HLA - D and glyoxalase I loci .
Therefore , in this family , the C2o gene is linked with two distinct haplotypes HLA - A25 , B18 , Dw2 , GLO1 and HLA - A25 , B18 , D unknown , GL02 .
These results could be explained by an ancestral recombinant event , which occurred between the C2o locus and HLA - D locus in which C2o segregated with HLA - B .
This would suggest that the locus for the C2o gene maps between HLA - B and HLA - D on the sixth chromosome . .
Germline mutations in the Wilms ' tumor suppressor gene are associated with abnormal urogenital development in Denys - Drash syndrome .
Denys - Drash syndrome is a rare human condition in which severe urogenital aberrations result in renal failure , pseudohermaphroditism , and Wilms tumor ( nephroblastoma ) .
To investigate its possible role , we have analyzed the coding exons of the Wilms tumor suppressor gene ( WT1 ) for germline mutations .
In ten independent cases of Denys - Drash syndrome , point mutations in the zinc finger domains of one WT1 gene copy were found .
Nine of these mutations are found within exon 9 ( zinc finger III ) ; the remaining mutation is in exon 8 ( zinc finger II ) .
These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition .
In two families analyzed , the mutations were shown to arise de novo .
Wilms tumors from three individuals and one juvenile granulosa cell tumor demonstrate reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 allele .
Our results provide evidence of a direct role for WT1 in Denys - Drash syndrome and thus urogenital system development . .
Linkage analysis in X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy and application in post - and prenatal diagnosis .
We have performed linkage analysis with the DNA markers DXS52 and the clotting factor VIII gene ( F8C ) , in several large families with X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) .
The tight linkage to DXS52 could be extended giving a maximal LOD score of 22 .
5 at 1 cM .
F8C was also tightly linked to ALD with a maximal LOD score of 7 .
8 without recombination .
Multipoint linkage analysis with the markers DXS304 , DXS52 , and F8C indicated that both the gene for ALD and for F8C are distal to DXS52 .
In four patients with ALD , no major structural rearrangement in the Xqter region was observed ; in particular , there were no abnormalities in the vision blindness genes .
DNA analysis appeared to be of use in determination of the carrier status of females at risk , for the determination of the origin of the mutation in a particular family , and for prenatal diagnosis .
Two distinct mutations at a single BamHI site in phenylketonuria .
Classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) .
The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene ( exon 7 ) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 ( 272gly - - - - stop and 273ser - - - - phe , respectively ) .
Both mutations were detected in north eastern France or Belgium and occurred on the background of RFLP haplotype 7 alleles .
The present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in PKU is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies . .
A detailed multipoint map of human chromosome 4 provides evidence for linkage heterogeneity and position - specific recombination rates .
Utilizing the CEPH reference panel and genotypic data for 53 markers , we have constructed a 20 - locus multipoint genetic map of human chromosome 4 .
New RFLPs are reported for four loci .
The map integrates a high - resolution genetic map of 4p16 into a continuous map extending to 4q31 and an unlinked cluster of three loci at 4q35 .
The 20 linked markers form a continuous linkage group of 152 cM in males and 202 cM in females .
Likely genetic locations are provided for 25 polymorphic anonymous sequences and 28 gene - specific RFLPs .
The map was constructed employing the LINKAGE and CRIMAP computational methodologies to build the multipoint map via a stepwise algorithm .
A detailed 10 - point map of the 4p16 region constructed from the CEPH panel provides evidence for heterogeneity in the linkage maps constructed from families segregating for Huntington disease ( HD ) .
It additionally provides evidence for position - specific recombination frequencies in the telomeric region of 4p . .
Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease using a combination of anonymous DNA polymorphisms and the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene cDNA .
We report carrier identification and a prenatal diagnosis using DNA polymorphisms in 2 families with X - linked Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) .
In both families , the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene in the single affected male could be traced back to his unaffected maternal grandfather .
Therefore , each family contains a new mutation .
In the case of the prenatal diagnosis , the fetus was shown by cytogenetic analysis to be a female , who we predict will be a noncarrier of PMD based on her genotype with the PLP intragenic polymorphism . .
Identification of deletion mutations and three new genes at the familial polyposis locus .
Small ( 100 - 260 kb ) , nested deletions were characterized in DNA from two unrelated patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) .
Three candidate genes located within the deleted region were ascertained and a previous candidate gene , MCC , was shown to be located outside the deleted region .
One of the new genes contained sequence identical to SRP19 , the gene coding for the 19 kd component of the ribosomal signal recognition particle .
The second , provisionally designated DP1 ( deleted in polyposis 1 ) , was found to be transcribed in the same orientation as MCC .
Two other cDNAs , DP2 and DP3 , were found to overlap , forming a single gene , DP2 .
5 , that is transcribed in the same orientation as SRP19 .
Exclusion of linkage between familial Mediterranean fever and the human serum amyloid A ( SAA ) gene cluster .
We studied the relationship between the autosomal recessive trait familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) and the serum amyloid A ( SAA ) genes by comparing alleles of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat and a conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) in the SAA gene cluster in Israeli FMF kindreds .
By haplotype analysis , our data indicate a minimum crossover frequency of 22 % between the SAA gene marker and FMF .
By conventional linkage analysis this eliminates a minimum of 10 .
4 cM including and surrounding the SAA gene cluster as the site of the FMF mutation although SAA proteins are prominent physiologic markers of the acute attacks .
PRAD1 , a candidate BCL1 oncogene : mapping and expression in centrocytic lymphoma .
Rearrangement of the BCL1 ( B - cell lymphoma 1 ) region on chromosome 11q13 appears to be highly characteristic of centrocytic lymphoma and also is found infrequently in other B - cell neoplasms .
Rearrangement is thought to deregulate a nearby protooncogene , but transcribed sequences in the immediate vicinity of BCL1 breakpoints had not been identified .
PRAD1 , previously designated D11S287E , was identified on 11q13 as a chromosomal breakpoint region rearranged with the parathyroid hormone gene in a subset of parathyroid adenomas ; this highly conserved putative oncogene , which encodes a novel cyclin , has been linked to BCL1 and implicated also in subsets of breast and squamous cell neoplasms with 11q13 amplification .
We report pulsed - field gel electrophoresis data showing BCL1 and PRAD1 to be no more than 130 kilobases apart .
PRAD1 mRNA is abundantly expressed in seven of seven centrocytic lymphomas ( Kiel classification ) , in contrast to 13 closely related but noncentrocytic lymphomas .
Three of the seven centrocytic lymphomas had detectable BCL1 DNA rearrangement .
Also , two unusual cases of CLL with BCL1 rearrangement overexpressed PRAD1 , in contrast to five CLL controls .
Thus , PRAD1 is an excellent candidate " BCL1 oncogene .
" Its overexpression may be a key consequence of rearrangement of the BCL1 vicinity in B - cell neoplasms and a unifying pathogenetic feature in centrocytic lymphoma .
Two new arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) patient .
Fragments of the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) gene from a patient with juvenile - onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors .
Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single - stranded phage DNA .
Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease - related mutations .
One , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine .
Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells .
About 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA .
The second mutation , a G - to - A transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice - recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron .
The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site .
Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele , but no ARSA activity or immuno - cross - reactive material could be detected .
A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations .
Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample .
Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data .
No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified .
However , combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late - onset forms of the disease .
The splice - site mutation following exon 7 produces late - infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme - null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . .
Analysis of X - chromosome inactivation and presumptive expression of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) gene in hematopoietic cell lineages of a thrombocytopenic carrier female of WAS .
We report on a thrombocytopenic female belonging to a pedigree with the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) .
Restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis with probe M27 beta , closely linked to the WAS gene , demonstrated that she is a carrier of WAS .
Both small - sized and normal - sized platelets were present , suggesting that , unlike the vast majority of WAS carriers , she does not manifest nonrandom X - chromosome inactivation in the thrombopoietic cell lineage .
Study of X - chromosome inactivation by means of RFLP and methylation analysis demonstrated that the pattern of X - chromosome inactivation was nonrandom in T lymphocytes , but random in granulocytes .
While this is the first complete report on the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in a carrier female of WAS as the result of atypical lyonization , it also suggests that expression of the WAS gene occurs at ( or extends up to ) a later stage than the multipotent stem cell along the hematopoietic differentiation pathway . .
A new mutation in the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene in a German family with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease .
A C - to - T transition in exon 4 of the PLP gene was found in 2 affected males and two obligate carriers in a German family with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease .
The mutation , which causes loss of an HphI site and changes amino acid 155 from threonine to isoleucine , was absent from 108 normal chromosomes .
There are 5 concordances and 1 discrepancy between these results and those obtained by magnetic resonance imaging in this family . .
A 3 - base pair in - frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria .
Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme , phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) .
The absence of PAH activity results in typical PKU while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease .
We report here a 3 - base pair in - frame deletion of the PAH gene ( delta 194 ) in a mild variant , with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine ( Km = 160 nM ) , and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype .
Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene , which presents no homology with other hydroxylases , we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine .
Finally , since none of the 98 PKU patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion , our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in Portugal . .
Mutation of the KIT ( mast / stem cell growth factor receptor ) protooncogene in human piebaldism .
Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by cogenital patches of skin and hair from which melanocytes are completely absent .
A similar disorder of mouse , dominant white spotting ( W ) , results from mutations of the c - Kit protooncogene , which encodes and receptor for mast / stem cell growth factor .
We identified a KIT gene mutation in a proband with classic autosomal dominant piebaldism .
This mutation results in a Gly - - - - Arg substitution at codon 664 , within the tyrosine kinase domain .
This substitution was not seen in any normal individuals and was completely linked to the piebald phenotype in the probands family .
Piebaldism in this family thus appears to be the human homologue to dominant white spotting ( W ) of the mouse . .
Genetic analysis of a Japanese family with normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia indicates a lack of linkage to the apolipoprotein B gene .
Normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia is a rare familial disorder characterized by an isolated deficiency of apoB - 100 .
We have previously reported a patient with this disease , who had normal apoB - 48 but no apoB - 100 .
To elucidate the genetic abnormalities in this family , we studied the linkage of apoB gene using three genetic markers .
The proband and her affected brother showed completely different apoB gene alleles , suggesting that the apoB gene itself is not related to this disorder in this family .
By contrast , an American case had a point substitution in the apoB gene generating an in - frame stop codon .
These results indicate that this disorder can be caused by defect ( s ) of either an apoB gene or other genes . .
Localisation of the gene for Norrie disease to between DXS7 and DXS426 on Xp .
A highly informative microsatellite marker , DXS426 , which maps proximal to DXS7 in the interval Xp11 .
4 - Xp11 4 - Xp11 .
23 , has been used to refine further the localisation of the gene for Norrie disease ( NDP ) .
The results from a multiply informative crossover localize the NDP gene proximal to DXS7 .
In conjunction with information from 2 NDP patients who have a deletion for DXS7 but not for DSX426 , our data indicate that the NDP gene lies between DXS7 and DXS426 on proximal Xp .
Aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA : the major cause for phenylketonuria in parts of southern Europe .
We report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mRNA and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6 , 10 , and 36 .
Because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in Bulgaria , Italy , and Turkey , it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of Europe .
The mutation is a G to A transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the PAH gene , 11 bp upstream from the intron 10 / exon 11 boundary .
It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in - frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA .
Normal amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous patients , but no catalytic activity can be detected .
This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids ( Gly - Leu - Gln ) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11 . .
Gardner syndrome in a boy with interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 .
We described a 15 - year - old boy with Gardner syndrome ( GS ) , mental retardation , and craniofacial abnormalities .
High - resolution banding analysis showed an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 ( q22 . 1 - - - - q31 1 - - - - q31 . 1 ) .
The breakpoints in the present case and in 3 previously reported 5q - patients with adenomatous polyposis coli suggest that the gene responsible for GS / or familial polyposis coli ( FPC ) is in the 5q22 region , a result consistent with the findings of linkage studies
Huntington disease and childhood - onset Tourette syndrome .
A 40 - year - old man with childhood - onset Tourette syndrome ( TS ) developed Huntington disease ( HD ) .
We believe this to be the first reported case of childhood - onset TS with adult onset HD .
Discovery of other cases with both disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both conditions . .
Sequence of DNA flanking the exons of the HEXA gene , and identification of mutations in Tay - Sachs disease .
The rapid identification of mutations causing Tay - Sachs disease requires the capacity to readily screen the regions of the HEXA gene most likely to be affected by mutation .
We have sequenced the portions of the introns flanking each of the 14 HEXA exons in order to specify oligonucleotide primers for the PCR - dependent amplification of each exon and splice - junction sequence .
The amplified products were analyzed , by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels , for the presence of either heteroduplexes , derived from the annealing of normal and mutant DNA strands , or single - strand conformational polymorphisms ( SSCP ) , derived from the renaturation of single - stranded DNA .
Five novel mutations from Tay - Sachs disease patients were detected a 5 - bp deletion of TCTCC in IVS - 9 ; a 2 - bp deletion of TG in exon 5 ; G78 to A , giving a stop codon in exon 1 ; G533 to T in exon 5 , producing the third amino acid substitution detected at this site ; and G to C at position 1 of IVS - 2 , expected to produce abnormal splicing .
In addition , two mutations , ( G1496 to A in exon 13 and a 4 - bp insertion in exon 11 ) that have previously been reported were identified . .
Molecular characterization of two galactosemia mutations : correlation of mutations with highly conserved domains in galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase .
Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of human galactose metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) .
The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood .
We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity .
First , we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine .
The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution ( conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine - proline - histidine triad and results in about 10 % of normal enzymatic activity .
The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date .
It accounts for one - fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied .
Second , we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan , caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025 .
The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E . coli , yeast , and humans , and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity , suggesting that this is a severe mutation .
This second mutation appears to be rare , since it was found only in the patient we sequenced .
Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of galactosemia at the molecular level , heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this disorder . .
Hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency : analysis of HPRT mutations by direct sequencing and allele - specific amplification .
The Lesch - Nyhan syndrome is a severe X chromosome - linked human disease caused by a virtual absence of hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) activity .
A partial deficiency in the activity of this enzyme can result in gouty arthritis .
To determine the genetic basis for reduction or loss of enzyme activity , we have amplified and sequenced the coding region of HPRT cDNA from four patients one with Lesch - Nyhan syndrome ( HPRTPerth ) and three with partial deficiencies of HPRT activity , which have been designated HPRTUrangan , HPRTSwan and HPRTToowong .
In all four patients , the only mutation identified was a single base substitution in exons 2 or 3 of the coding region , which in each case predicts a single amino acid substitution in the translated protein .
Each base change was confirmed by allele - specific amplification of the patients genomic DNA .
It is interesting to note that the mutation found for HPRTPerth is identical to that reported for HPRTFlint .
It appears that the two mutations are de novo events . .
Molecular and metabolic basis for the metabolic disorder normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia .
We have previously described a disorder , normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia , that is characterized by the virtual absence of plasma low density lipoproteins and complete absence of apoB - 100 , but with apparently normal secretion of triglyceride - rich lipoproteins containing apoB - 48 .
The patients plasma lipoproteins were shown on polyacrylamide gels and by antibody mapping to have a new truncated apoB variant , apoB - 50 , circulating along with her apoB - 48 .
We have found this individual to be homozygous for a single C - to - T nucleotide substitution at apoB codon 2252 , which produces a premature in - frame stop codon .
Thus , this is a rare example of homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia .
Electron photomicrographs revealed that the diameters of particles in the d less than 1 .
006 g / ml lipoprotein fraction , in both the postprandial and postabsorptive state , are bimodally distributed .
The molar ratio of apoE to apoB in these particles is 3 .
5 1 , similar to normal VLDL .
The plasma LDL interval contains both spherical and cuboidal particles .
Autologous reinfusion of labeled d less than 1 .
006 g / ml lipoproteins showed exponential disappearance from plasma , with an apparent half - removal time of 50 min , somewhat slower than for normal chylomicrons but within the normal range for VLDL .
The calculated production rate for apoB was within the normal range in this subject .
A single origin of phenylketonuria in Yemenite Jews .
Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) .
The incidence of PKU varies widely across different geographic areas , and is highest ( about 1 in 5 , 000 live births ) in Ireland and western Scotland , and among Yemenite Jews .
A limited number of point mutations account for most of the PKU cases in the European population .
Here we report that a single molecular defect - - a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene - - is responsible for all the PKU cases among the Yemenite Jews .
Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community .
Although the deleted PAH gene was traced to 25 different locations throughout Yemen , family histories and official documents of the Yemenite Jewish community showed that the common ancestor of all the carriers of this genetic defect lived in Sana , the capital of Yemen , before the eighteenth century . .
Linkage of aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) to marker loci on the long arm of chromosome 4 .
Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) .
The structural gene for AGA has been assigned to the region 4q21 - qter of chromosome 4 .
We have studied the map position of the AGU locus in relation to other marker loci on the long arm of chromosome 4 using linkage analyses .
Restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles for the ADH2 , ADH3 , EGF , FG alpha and FG beta loci and blood group antigens for the MNS locus were determined in a panel of 12 Finnish AGU families .
The heterozygous family members were identified by reduced activity of AGA in lymphocytes .
Linkage studies were performed using both pairwise and multipoint analyses .
Loose linkage of the AGU locus to the FG and MNS loci was observed ( z = 1 . 16 , z = 1 . 39 , respectively ) .
Multipoint analysis to the fixed map [ ADH - ( 0 . 03 ) - EGF - ( 0 . 35 ) - FG - ( 0 . 11 ) - MNS ] suggests that the location of the AGU locus is 0 .
05 - 0 .
30 recombination units distal to MNS ( z = 3 . 03 ) .
The order cen - ADH - EGF - FG - MNS - AGU is 35 times more likely than the next best order cen - ADH - EGF - AGU - FG - MNS .
Linkage relationships of the apolipoprotein C1 gene and a cytochrome P450 gene ( CYP2A ) to myotonic dystrophy .
We have studied the genetic linkage of two markers , the apolipoprotein C1 ( APOC1 ) gene and a cytochrome P450 ( CYP2A ) gene , in relation to the gene for myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) .
A peak lod score of 9 .
29 at 2 cM was observed for APOC1 - DM , with a lod score of 8 .
55 at 4 cM for CYP2A - DM .
These two markers also show close linkage to each other ( theta max = 0 . 05 , Zmax = 9 . 09 ) .
From examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals , CYP2A appears to map proximal to DM because in one recombinant individual CYP2A , APOC2 and CKMM had all recombined with DM .
Evidence from another CYP2A - DM recombinant individual places CYP2A proximal to APOC2 and CKMM .
Localisation of CYP2A on a panel of somatic cell hybrids also suggests that it is proximal to DM and APOC2 / C1 / E gene cluster .
Genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers around the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis on chromosome 5 .
A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene ( APC ) for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) on chromosome 5q is reported .
One hundred fifty - five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis .
A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci , allowing confident ordering of parts of the map .
There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity , with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene .
Recombination data and two - point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere - pi 227 - C11P11 - ECB27 - L5 .
62 - APC - EF5 62 - APC - EF5 .
44 - YN5 44 - YN5 .
48 - telomer e , although EF5 .
44 could lie in the interval L5 .
62 - APC or ECB27 - L5 .
62 .
No recombinants were identified between APC and either EF5 .
44 or YN5 .
48 , but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP suggest that YN5 .
48 is 1 - 3 cM from APC .
The present study suggests that YN5 .
48 and L5 .
62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the EF5 .
44 locus lies very close to the APC gene .
These data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP but also provide a high - density map of the region for isolation of the APC gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer .
Serum amyloid A and P protein genes in familial Mediterranean fever .
Two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid A ( SAA ) and P ( APCS ) genes in familial Mediterranean fever ( MEF ) .
To test the role of SAA and APCS in MEF and MEF - amyloidosis , we studied 17 informative families ( 15 Armenians , 2 non - Ashkenazi Jews ) and 8 MEF patients with amyloidosis using a candidate gene approach .
No evidence for any MEF - associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 Armenian and Jewish MEF patients tested .
Our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between SAA and MEF ( lod score = - 2 . 16 , theta less than or equal to 0 . 06 ) .
For APCS we found that the allele frequency in the MEF - amyloidosis patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated MEF patients without amyloidosis and their 33 healthy parents .
Some Mexican glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited .
Glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency appears to be fairly common in Mexico .
We have now examined the DNA of three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants , - G6PD Distrito Federal , G6PD Tepic , and G6PD Castilla .
All three of these variants , believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique , have the G - - - - A transition at nucleotide 202 and the A - - - - G transition at nucleotide 376 , mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of G6PD A - .
Two other Mexican males with G6PD deficiency were found to have the same mutation .
All five have the ( NlaIII / FokI / PvuII / PstI ) haplotype characteristic of G6PD A - in Africa .
Since the PvuII + genotype seems to be rare in Europe , we conclude that all of these G6PD A - genes had their ancient origin in Africa , although in many of the Mexican patients with G6PD A - 202A / 376G the gene may have been imported more recently from Spain , where this variant , formerly known as G6PD Betica , is also prevalent . .
Hereditary deficiency of C5 in association with discoid lupus erythematosus .
A 29 - year - old woman with discoid lupus erythematosus had undetectable classic pathway complement activity .
Hypocomplementemia was due to selective deficiency of C5 .
One of her children was also deficient .
To our knowledge this is the first documented case of an association between discoid lupus erythematosus and C5 deficiency . .
Founder effect of a prevalent phenylketonuria mutation in the Oriental population .
A missense mutation has been identified in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase [ PAH ; phenylalanine 4 - monooxygenase ; L - phenylalanine , tetrahydrobiopterin oxygen oxidoreductase ( 4 - hydroxylating ) , EC 1 . 14 . 16 . 1 ] gene in a Chinese patient with classic phenylketonuria ( PKU ) .
A G - to - C transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of Pro413 for Arg413 in the mutant protein .
This mutation ( R413P ) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic PKU phenotype in the patient .
Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4 , which is the predominant haplotype of the PAH locus in the Oriental population .
It accounts for 13 .
8 % of northern Chinese and 27 % of Japanese PKU alleles , but it is rare in southern Chinese ( 2 . 2 % ) and is absent in the Caucasian population .
The data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of Orientals and Caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the Orient by a founder effect .
Previous protein polymorphism studies in eastern Asia have led to the hypothesis that " northern Mongoloids " represented a founding population in Asia .
Our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the PKU mutation might have occurred in northern Mongoloids and subsequently spread to the Chinese and Japanese populations .
Glucose / galactose malabsorption caused by a defect in the Na + / glucose cotransporter .
Glucose / galactose malabsorption ( GGM ) is an autosomal recessive disease manifesting within the first weeks of life and characterized by a selective failure to absorb dietary glucose and galactose from the intestine .
The consequent severe diarrhoea and dehydration are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet .
Intestinal biopsies of GGM patients have revealed a specific defect in Na ( + ) - dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border .
