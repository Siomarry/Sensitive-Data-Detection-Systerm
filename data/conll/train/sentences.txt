Identification of APC2 , a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor .
The adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour - suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK - 3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin .
Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin .
In colon carcinoma cells , loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the Tcf - 4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) .
Here , we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues .
Mammalian APC2 , which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure , was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains , both of which are required for binding to conductin .
Like APC , APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin - Tcf complexes , as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC - / - colon carcinoma cells .
Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13 .
3 .
APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer .
A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families : origin , phenotypic expression , and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer .
The frequency , origin , and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non - polyposis cancer syndrome ( HNPCC ) was investigated .
The mutation ( A - - > T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported .
Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed .
In contrast , the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland .
To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) , haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed .
Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families .
In contrast , a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families .
These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families .
We calculated age related risks of all , colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A - - > T MSH2 mutation carriers ( n = 76 ) for all patients and for men and women separately .
For both sexes combined , the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers and for colorectal cancer were 0 .
86 and 0 .
57 , respectively .
The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) in males than females ( 0 . 63 v 0 . 30 and 0 . 84 v 0 . 44 at ages 50 and 60 years , respectively ) .
For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer ( 0 . 5 at age 60 years ) and premenopausal ovarian cancer ( 0 . 2 at 50 years ) .
These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers .
Age of onset in Huntington disease : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein E genotype and normal CAG repeat length .
Age of onset ( AO ) of Huntington disease ( HD ) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene .
Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease , rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too .
We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length .
Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information .
In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients , we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females .
Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes .
Our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration in HD may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon AO .
Familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent bacteremic infections due to Neisseria .
The serum of a 29 - year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity .
The seventh component of complement ( C7 ) was not detected by functional or immunochemical assays , whereas other components were normal by hemolytic and immunochemical assessment .
Her fresh serum lacked complement - mediated bactericidal activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae , but the addition of fresh normal serum or purified C7 restored bactericidal activity as well as hemolytic activity .
The absence of functional C7 activity could not be accounted for on the basis of an inhibitor .
Opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity functioned normally .
Complete absence of C7 was also found in one sibling who had the clinical syndrome of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child and in this siblings clinically well eight - year - old son .
HLA histocompatibility typing of the family members did not demonstrate evidence for genetic linkage of C7 deficiency with the major histocompatibility loci .
This report represents the first cases of C7 deficiency associated with infectious complications and suggests that bactericidal activity may be important in host defense against bacteremic neisseria infections .
Increased incidence of cancer in patients with cartilage - hair hypoplasia .
OBJECTIVE Previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage - hair hypoplasia ( CHH ) .
This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first - degree relatives .
STUDY DESIGN One hundred twenty - two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 .
Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center .
This cohort underwent follow - up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995 .
RESULTS A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non - Hodgkins lymphoma ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) .
In addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) .
The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population .
CONCLUSIONS This study confirms an increased risk of cancer , especially non - Hodgkins lymphoma , probably attributable to defective immunity , among patients with CHH .
Genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency .
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine - uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype .
In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD .
In this group of patients , 7 different mutations have been identified , including 2 deletions [ 295 - 298delTCAT , 1897delC ] , 1 splice - site mutation [ IVS14 + 1G > A ) ] and 4 missense mutations ( 85T > C , 703C > T , 2658G > A , 2983G > T ) .
Analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among DPD patients has shown that the G - - > A point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common ( 52 % ) , whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed .
A large phenotypic variability has been observed , with convulsive disorders , motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations .
A clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established .
An altered beta - alanine , uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with DPD deficiency .
Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 ( FHF2 ) : gene structure , expression and mapping to the Borjeson - Forssman - Lehmann syndrome region in Xq26 delineated by a duplication breakpoint in a BFLS - like patient .
Borjeson - Forssman - Lehmann syndrome ( BFLS ) is a syndromal X - linked mental retardation , which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome .
We have identified a male patient with BFLS - like features and a duplication , 46 , Y , dup ( X ) ( q26q28 ) , inherited from his phenotypically normal mother .
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400 - kb interval in the Xq26 .
3 region between DXS155 and DXS294 / DXS730 .
Database searches and analysis of available genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gene , FHF2 , within the duplication breakpoint interval .
The gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified , including a new 5 end exon , 1B .
FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in Xq26 .
3 and is composed of at least seven exons .
It shows tissue - specific alternative splicing and alternative transcription starts .
Northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle .
The FHF2 gene localisation and tissue - specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial cases of the BFLS syndrome and other syndromal and non - specific forms of X - linked mental retardation mapping to the region .
Germline E - cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer .
Inherited mutations in the E - cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer .
Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non - Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations .
Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences .
Each family contained ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer .
Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25 % ) .
Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E - cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain .
In one family there was evidence of non - penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years .
We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non - Maori populations .
However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations .
Loss of E - cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer .
Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .
A zinc finger truncation of murine WT1 results in the characteristic urogenital abnormalities of Denys - Drash syndrome .
The Wilms tumor - suppressor gene , WT1 , plays a key role in urogenital development , and WT1 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic ( Wilms tumor , mesothelioma , leukemias , and breast cancer ) and nonneoplastic ( glomerulosclerosis ) disease .
The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations , such as Denys - Drash syndrome ( DDS ) , can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease .
DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis , XY pseudohermaphroditism , and / or Wilms tumor ( WT ) .
DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1 , which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C - terminal zinc finger ( ZF ) region .
We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele , Wt1 ( tmT396 ) , which truncates ZF3 at codon 396 , induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice .
Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event , implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice .
However , the mutant WT1 ( tmT396 ) protein accounted for only 5 % of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT .
This has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect .
Mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter DMT1 .
Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption .
We recently reported that HFE , the protein defective in HH , was physically associated with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin - bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells , leading to up - regulation of transporters for dietary iron .
Here , we tested the hypothesis that HFE - / - mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter ( DMT1 ) .
By 4 weeks of age , the HFE - / - mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE + / + littermates , with elevated transferrin saturations ( 68 . 4 % vs . 49 . 8 % ) and elevated liver iron concentrations ( 985 micrograms vs . 381 micrograms ) .
By using Northern blot analyses , we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts one containing an iron responsive element ( IRE ) , called DMT1 ( IRE ) , and one containing no IRE , called DMT1 ( non - IRE ) .
The positive control for DMT1 up - regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA .
HFE - / - mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA ( average 7 . 7 - fold ) , despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content .
Duodenal expression of DMT1 ( non - IRE ) was not increased , nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased .
These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron , with resultant stabilization of DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA , up - regulation of DMT1 , and increased absorption of dietary iron .
Neurophysiologic follow - up of long - term dietary treatment in adult - onset adrenoleukodystrophy .
OBJECTIVE To monitor the effects of dietary treatment in adult - onset adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) by means of somatosensory evoked potentials ( SEPs ) and motor evoked potentials ( MEPs ) .
BACKGROUND SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe , central dying - back axonopathy in early stages of adult - onset ALD .
METHODS Eight patients with adult - onset ALD underwent clinical examination , brain and spine MRI , and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy .
RESULTS Before treatment , brain MRI was normal in five patients .
Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts .
After treatment , the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening , whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease ( exhibited by SEPs ) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features .
The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening .
CONCLUSIONS Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions .
Moreover , in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage , this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease .
However , because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms , SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI .
GCH1 mutation in a patient with adult - onset oromandibular dystonia .
The authors report a mutation in exon 5 of GCH1 in a patient with adult - onset oromandibular dystonia and no obvious family history of dystonia .
The patient responded positively to treatment with L - dopa .
These findings demonstrate that GCH1 mutations must be considered even in patients with dystonic symptoms not typical of dopa - responsive dystonia .
Germline mutations of the APC gene in Korean familial adenomatous polyposis patients .
We extensively analyzed genomic DNA and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) from 62 unrelated Korean patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) for identification of germline adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations .
We adopted both single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and a method of analysis involving the reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) followed by a protein truncation test ( PTT ) .
DNA sequencing confirmed all alterations represented by aberrant bands .
Germline mutations were identified in 38 patients ( 61 % ) .
Nineteen of the detected mutations were presumed to be novel , thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in Korean FAP patients .
In the initial 48 patients , SSCP analysis was followed by PTT for those patients for whom no detectable mutations were found by SSCP .
Using this combined approach , we identified germline APC gene mutations in 29 of the 48 FAP patients ( 60 % ) , including 6 patients in whom SSCP analysis failed to distinguish the mutant allele .
In the 14 later patients , we identified truncating mutations in 9 patients ( 64 % ) using PTT only .
Our results confirm that the mutation detection rate with PTT was superior to that with SSCP , and suggest that PTT would be a more practical screening method to detect germline mutations of the APC gene in FAP patients .
Molecular epidemiology of C9 deficiency heterozygotes with an Arg95Stop mutation of the C9 gene in Japan .
Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement ( C9 ) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan , with an incidence of approximately one homozygote in 1000 , but is very rare in other countries .
Genetic analyses of Japanese C9 deficiency have shown that a C - to - T transition leading to TGA stop codon for Arg95 in exon 4 of the C9 gene ( Arg95Stop ) is common in Japanese C9 deficiency .
To determine the prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation in a Japanese population , we collected DNA samples from 300 individuals in two of the four main islands of Japan .
Heterozygote detection was performed with an allele - specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles , followed by confirmation with PCR / single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and direct sequencing .
Twenty individuals were heterozygous for the Arg95Stop mutation .
None was homozygous .
The prevalence of carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation was 6 .
7 % ( 20 / 300 ) .
An estimated frequency ( 0 . 12 % ) of complete C9 deficiency due to homozygous Arg95Stop mutation was consistent with frequencies determined by serological studies
The hereditary hemochromatosis protein , HFE , specifically regulates transferrin - mediated iron uptake in HeLa cells .
HFE is the protein product of the gene mutated in the autosomal recessive disease hereditary hemochromatosis ( Feder , J .

At the cell surface , HFE complexes with transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , increasing the dissociation constant of transferrin ( Tf ) for its receptor 10 - fold ( Gross , C .

HFE does not remain at the cell surface , but traffics with TfR to Tf - positive internal compartments ( Gross et al . , 1998 ) .
Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline , we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33 % but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling .
Therefore , HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments .
HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf , as non - Tf - mediated iron uptake from Fe - nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered .
These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf - mediated pathway of iron uptake .
These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver , pancreas , heart , and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE .
Mutation and haplotype studies of familial Mediterranean fever reveal new ancestral relationships and evidence for a high carrier frequency with reduced penetrance in the Ashkenazi Jewish population .
Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis .
The FMF gene ( MEFV ) was cloned recently , and four missense mutations were identified .
Here we present data from non - Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new , more ethnically diverse panel .
Among 90 symptomatic mutation - positive individuals , 11 mutations accounted for 79 % of carrier chromosomes .
Of the two mutations that are novel , one alters the same residue ( 680 ) as a previously known mutation , and the other ( P369S ) is located in exon 3 .
Consistent with another recent report , the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes , but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non - Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations .
Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples , the MEFV carrier frequency was 21 % , with E148Q the most common mutation .
Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews , especially for E148Q , P369S , and K695R .
Nevertheless , E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF .
The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region .
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome with defective Fas : genotype influences penetrance .
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance .
Most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the APT1 gene , which encodes Fas ( CD95 , APO - 1 ) , mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis .
Of 17 unique APT1 mutations in unrelated ALPS probands , 12 ( 71 % ) occurred in exons 7 - 9 , which encode the intracellular portion of Fas .
In vitro , activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti - Fas agonist monoclonal antibody .
Similar defects were found in a Fas - negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations .
In cotransfection experiments , Fas constructs with either intra - or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild - type Fas .
Two missense Fas variants , not restricted to patients with ALPS , were identified .
Variant A ( - 1 ) T at the Fas signal - sequence cleavage site , which mediates apoptosis less well than wild - type Fas and is partially inhibitory , was present in 13 % of African American alleles .
Among the ALPS - associated Fas mutants , dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular , versus extracellular , portion of the Fas receptor .
Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation - bearing relatives .
Significant ALPS - related morbidity occurred in 44 % of relatives with intracellular mutations , versus 0 % of relatives with extracellular mutations .
Thus , the location of mutations within APT1 strongly influences the development and the severity of ALPS .
Multicentric origin of hemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) mutations .
Genetic hemochromatosis ( GH ) is believed to be a disease restricted to those of European ancestry .
In northwestern Europe , > 80 % of GH patients are homozygous for one mutation , the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 ( C282Y ) in the unprocessed protein .
In a proportion of GH patients , two mutations are present , C282Y and H63D .
The clinical significance of this second mutation is such that it appears to predispose 1 % - 2 % of compound heterozygotes to expression of the disease .
The distribution of the two mutations differ , C282Y being limited to those of northwestern European ancestry and H63D being found at allele frequencies > 5 % , in Europe , in countries bordering the Mediterranean , in the Middle East , and in the Indian subcontinent .
The C282Y mutation occurs on a haplotype that extends < / = 6 Mb , suggesting that this mutation has arisen during the past 2 , 000 years .
The H63D mutation is older and does not occur on such a large extended haplotype , the haplotype in this case extending < / = 700 kb .
Here we report the finding of the H63D and C282Y mutations on new haplotypes .
In Sri Lanka we have found H63D on three new haplotypes and have found C282Y on one new haplotype , demonstrating that these mutations have arisen independently on this island .
These results suggest that the HFE gene has been the subject of selection pressure .
These selection pressures could be due to infectious diseases , environmental conditions , or other genetic disorders such as anemia .
A retrospective anonymous pilot study in screening newborns for HFE mutations in Scandinavian populations .
We have retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot ( DBS ) samples from neonatal screening programs in Scandinavia for mutations in HFE , the candidate gene for hemochromatosis .
We have found C282Y allele frequencies of 2 .
3 % ( + 2 . 0 % ) ( - 1 . 3 % ) in Greenland , 4 .
5 % + / - 1 .
9 % in Iceland , 5 .
1 % + / - 2 .
3 % in the Faeroe Islands , and 8 .
2 % + / - 2 .
7 % in Denmark .
The high prevalence of HFE mutations in Denmark suggests that population screening for the C282Y mutation could be highly advantageous in terms of preventive health care .
Long - term follow - up evaluation of C282Y homozygotes and H63D / C282Y compound heterozygotes will give an indication of the penetrance of the mutations .
Identification of the mutation in the alkaptonuria mouse model .
Alkaptonuria ( aku ) , an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1 , 2 - dioxygenase ( HGD ) , has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified .
We used RT - PCR to amplify the Hgd cDNA from Hgd ( aku ) / Hgd ( aku ) mice .
Two products shorter than the wild - type product were amplified .
Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were then used to identify the Hgd ( aku ) mouse mutation , found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence , causing exon skipping and frame - shifted products .
This base change allowed us to create a non - radioactive genotyping assay for this allele .
Non - syndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is caused by PDS mutations .
Enlarged vestibular aqueduct ( EVA ) , known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality , has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner .
The locus for non - syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA has been mapped to the same chromosomal region , 7q31 , as the Pendred syndrome locus .
In the present study , seven mutations in the PDS gene ( PDS ) , the gene responsible for Pendred syndrome , have been found in families of non - syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA .
One family is homozygous , three families are compound heterozygotes , and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected .
The present results provide evidence that mutations in PDS cause both syndromic and non - syndromic hearing loss . .
Mutational analysis and genotype - phenotype correlation of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy .
BACKGROUND X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction , occasionally associated with adrenal insufficiency .
The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood ( childhood cerebral ALD ) , with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state .
Adult - onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction .
Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized .
Despite discovery of the causative gene , a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated .
OBJECTIVES To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families , to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene , and to study genotype - phenotype correlations in Japanese patients .
METHODS The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD , 11 patients with adult - onset cerebral ALD , and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy .
We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts , lymphoblastoid cells , or peripheral blood leukocytes .
RESULTS Three patients with adult - onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements .
The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations , including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene .
Eighteen ( 69 % ) of 26 mutations were missense mutations .
Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products , including PMP70 , mALDRP , and Pxa1p .
The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081 - 1082 , which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients ( 12 % - 17 % ) , was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients ( 12 % ) .
All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes .
There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids .
CONCLUSIONS There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes , suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD . .
A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta - catenin .
WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs .
In response to this stimulus , cytoplasmic beta - catenin ( encoded by CTNNB1 ) is stabilized , enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF / TCF family .
One of the target genes for beta - catenin / TCF encodes c - MYC , explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon .
Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , a protein required for ubiquitin - mediated degradation of beta - catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta - catenin - stabilizing mutations .
Recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta - catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas .
Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair - follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta - catenin - stabilizing mutations .
Here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour .
We found nuclear LEF - 1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells .
At least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino - terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation - dependent , ubiquitin - mediated degradation of the protein .
This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far , and directly implicates beta - catenin / LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans . .
The Pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride - iodide transport protein .
Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre .
This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome ( PDS ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning .
PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin .
Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate - anion transporter ( encoded by Sat - 1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by DTD ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by DRA ; 45 % ) .
On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate - transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter .
We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS - recombinant baculovirus .
The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems .
Our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide , but not sulfate , and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of Pendred syndrome . .
HFE mutations analysis in 711 hemochromatosis probands : evidence for S65C implication in mild form of hemochromatosis .
Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder of iron metabolism .
The HFE candidate gene encoding an HLA class I - like protein involved in HH was identified in 1996 .
Two missense mutations have been described C282Y , accounting for 80 % to 90 % of HH chromosomes , and H63D , which is associated with a milder form of the disease representing 40 % to 70 % of non - C282Y HH chromosomes .
We report here on the analysis of C282Y , H63D , and the 193A - - > T substitution leading to the S65C missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls .
The results confirm that the C282Y substitution was the main mutation involved in hemochromatosis , accounting for 85 % of carrier chromosomes , whereas the H63D substitution represented 39 % of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y mutation .
In addition , our screening showed that the S65C substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation .
This substitution accounted for 7 .
8 % of HH chromosomes that were neither C282Y nor H63D .
This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggests that the S65C substitution is associated with the mild form of hemochromatosis .
Germline BRCA1 alterations in a population - based series of ovarian cancer cases .
The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population .
To achieve this , we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population - based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases .
This is the first population - based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region .
One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing .
Two truncating mutations , 962del4 and 3600del11 , were identified .
Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer .
Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified , some of which were associated with a family history of cancer .
The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele - specific amplification .
The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly ( P = 0 . 03 ) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer , suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk .
In summary , our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk , and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population .
Adrenoleukodystrophy - related protein can compensate functionally for adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency ( X - ALD ) : implications for therapy .
Inherited defects in the peroxisomal ATP - binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein ( ALDP ) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X - ALD ) , for which no efficient treatment has been established so far .
Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known adrenoleukodystrophy - related protein ( ALDRP ) , 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein ( PMP70 ) and PMP70 - related protein .
By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP , we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta - oxidation in fibroblasts of X - ALD patients .
The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X - ALD cells .
Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself .
Moreover , we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta - oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP - deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate .
These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X - ALD could be possible by drug - induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP . .
Centrosome amplification and a defective G2 - M cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in BRCA1 exon 11 isoform - deficient cells .
Germline mutations of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers .
To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1 - related tumorigenesis , we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene .
We show that the mutant cells maintain an intact G1 - S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly .
However , a defective G2 - M checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities .
Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple , functional centrosomes , which lead to unequal chromosome segregation , abnormal nuclear division , and aneuploidy .
These data uncover an essential role of BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2 - M checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis . .
Defective CD95 / APO - 1 / Fas signal complex formation in the human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome , type Ia .
Heterozygous mutations in the CD95 ( APO - 1 / Fas ) receptor occur in most individuals with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) and dominantly interfere with apoptosis by an unknown mechanism .
We show that local or global alterations in the structure of the cytoplasmic death domain from nine independent ALPS CD95 death - domain mutations result in a failure to bind the FADD / MORT1 signaling protein .
Despite heterozygosity for the abnormal allele , lymphocytes from ALPS patients showed markedly decreased FADD association and a loss of caspase recruitment and activation after CD95 crosslinking .
These data suggest that intracytoplasmic CD95 mutations in ALPS impair apoptosis chiefly by disrupting death - domain interactions with the signaling protein FADD / MORT1 . .
Analysis of alkaptonuria ( AKU ) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the CCC sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) .
We recently showed that alkaptonuria ( AKU ) is caused by loss - of - function mutations in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) .
Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees .
These analyses identified two novel single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( INV4 + 31A - - > G and INV11 + 18A - - > G ) and six novel AKU mutations ( INV1 - 1G - - > A , W60G , Y62C , A122D , P230T , and D291E ) , which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU .
Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement , GGG , are preferentially mutated .
These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short - sequence motifs .
Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion ( 34 . 5 % ) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO , we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO .
Fabry disease : identification of novel alpha - galactosidase A mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches .
Fabry disease ( FD ) ( angiokeratoma corporis diffusum ) is an X - linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha - galactosidase A gene ( GLA ) .
The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha - galactosyl moieties .
Clinically , affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma , severe acroparesthesia , renal failure , and vasculopathy of the heart and brain .
While demonstration of alpha - galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males , enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive , due to random X - chromosomal inactivation , underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling .
By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence - based detection systems , we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha - Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD .
The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations ( C202W , C223G , N224D , R301Q , and Q327K ) and one splice - site mutation [ IVS3 G ( - 1 ) - - > C ] .
Studies at the mRNA level showed that the latter led to altered pre - mRNA splicing with consequent alteration of the mRNA translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation .
By use of this strategy , carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at - risk females tested , whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity . .
Prenatal diagnosis by FISH in a family with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease caused by duplication of PLP gene .
A diagnosis of Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease ( MIM 312080 ) was made in a young boy .
No mutation in the coding region of the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene had been found .
The boys maternal aunt came for prenatal diagnosis when 16 + weeks pregnant and carrying a male fetus .
Samples were tested for duplication of the PLP gene , by interphase FISH , in lymphocyte preparations from the proband , his aunt and an amniotic fluid cell preparation from the fetus .
The proband was found to carry the duplication , thus confirming the diagnosis of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease , but neither the aunt nor the fetus carried a duplication . .
Dominant negative effect of the APC1309 mutation : a possible explanation for genotype - phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis .
Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis .
Patients with familial APC ( FAP ) carry germ - line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life .
The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation ( genotype - phenotype correlation ) .
Together with the fact that both germ - line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants .
Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta - catenin - / Tcf - mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells .
Here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis .
Wild - type APC activity in beta - catenin - / Tcf - mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309 .
In contrast , mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild - type APC activity .
These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype - phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be , in part , driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region . .
BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex .
Germ - line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor - suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer .
BRCA1 contains a carboxyl - terminal domain ( BRCT ) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity .
In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1 , we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain .
Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis .
Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb - binding proteins , RbAp46 and RbAp48 , as well as with Rb .
Moreover , the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 .
These results demonstrate that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex , and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1 in multiple processes such as transcription , DNA repair , and recombination . .
Combined genetic deficiency of C6 and C7 in man .
By routine screening of sera , a subject was discovered who showed a sub - total deficiency of C6 and C7 .
No clinical disease was associated with this deficiency which was transmitted through the subjects family as a single genetic characteristic , the C6 deficiency being associated with a silent allele at the structural locus .
The propositus was found to have low quantities of an abnormal C6 which was both antigenically deficient and smaller in size than normal C6 ( 110 , 000 daltons compared with 140 , 000 daltons ) and small quantities of apparently normal C7 .
It is concluded that the most likely explanation for this defect is that the subject has a structural mutation in his C6 gene which produces hyopsynthesis not only of C6 but also of the closely linked gene for C7 .
These findings suggest the possibility that C6 and C7 may function as a single genetic unit and that the primary transcript copied from the genome includes information for both proteins . .
Changes at P183 of emerin weaken its protein - protein interactions resulting in X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy .
Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is an X - linked recessive muscular dystrophy characterized by early contractures of the elbows , Achilles tendons and spine , slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness , and cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac conduction defects .
The emerin gene has been mapped to Xq28 and encodes a 34 - kDa serine - rich protein , emerin , which has been localized to the nuclear envelope in a wide variety of tissues , including skeletal and cardiac muscle .
Mutations spanning the emerin gene have been identified in patients with EDMD .
We present here the effect , on emerin protein expression , of two missense mutations identified in unrelated EDMD patients .
These alterations predict the replacement of a proline residue at position 183 with either a histidine or a threonine .
Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the mobility and expression levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from that of wild - type emerin , but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear lamina components .
In comparison with the usual EDMD phenotype , patients with P183 missense mutations have a later age at onset of first symptoms , elbow contractures , ankle contractures , upper limb weakness and lower limb weakness , but there is no difference for the age at onset of cardiac involvement .
This is the first report of protein studies on patients with missense mutations resulting in the clinical features of EDMD .
These studies demonstrate the importance of proline 183 for the proper structure / function of emerin . .
Microdeletions at chromosome bands 1q32 - q41 as a cause of Van der Woude syndrome .
Van der Woude syndrome ( VWS ) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and / or cleft palate and lip pits .
We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500 - 800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32 - q41 [ Sander et al . , 1994 Hum Mol Genet 3 576 - 578 ] .
Along with cleft lip / palate and lip pits , affected relatives exhibit developmental delays , suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted .
To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS .
An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker , D1S3753 .
From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals , we detected an allele loss in one family , indicating the presence of a deletion .
In this family , the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of VWS .
Surprisingly , mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0 .
2 - 1 Mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously .
No deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia syndrome , 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate , and 178 cases of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate .
Splicing defects in the ataxia - telangiectasia gene , ATM : underlying mutations and consequences .
Mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion ( 30 / 62 [ 48 % ] ) of a new series of mutations in the ATM gene in patients with ataxia - telangiectasia ( AT ) that were detected by the protein - truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic DNA .
Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice - acceptor site or GT splice - donor site .
A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites , including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons , mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites , and creation of splice - acceptor or splice - donor sites in either introns or exons .
These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences , including exon skipping and , to a lesser degree , intron retention , activation of cryptic splice sites , or creation of new splice sites .
In addition , 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred .
No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified .
Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed , suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations . .
Alpha - cardiac actin is a novel disease gene in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .
We identified the alpha - cardiac actin gene ( ACTC ) as a novel disease gene in a pedigree suffering from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( FHC ) .
Linkage analyses excluded all the previously reported FHC loci as possible disease loci in the family studied , with lod scores varying between - 2 .
5 and - 6 .
0 0 .
Further linkage analyses of plausible candidate genes highly expressed in the adult human heart identified ACTC as the most likely disease gene , showing a maximal lod score of 3 .
6 6 .
Mutation analysis of ACTC revealed an Ala295Ser mutation in exon 5 close to 2 missense mutations recently described to cause the inherited form of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( IDC ) .
Overgrowth of oral mucosa and facial skin , a novel feature of aspartylglucosaminuria .
Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) .
The main symptom is progressive mental retardation .
A spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this disease , one missense mutation ( Cys163Ser ) being responsible for the majority of Finnish cases .
We were able to examine 66 Finnish AGU patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin .
Biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions , 12 of them associated with the teeth , plus two facial lesions were studied histologically .
Immunohistochemical staining for AGA was performed on 15 oral specimens .
Skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients , with erythema of the facial skin already common in childhood .
Of 44 patients , nine ( 20 % ) had facial angiofibromas , tumours primarily occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis .
Oedemic buccal mucosa ( leucoedema ) and gingival overgrowths were more frequent in AGU patients than in controls ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Of 16 oral mucosal lesions studied histologically , 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias and were reactive in nature .
Cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four .
Immunohistochemically , expression of AGA in AGU patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects .
Thus , the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in AGU patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of AGA expression .
Characterization of a germline mosaicism in families with Lowe syndrome , and identification of seven novel mutations in the OCRL1 gene .
The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) is an X - linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes , nervous system , and kidneys .
Mutations in the OCRL1 gene have been associated with the disease .
OCRL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PtdIns [ 4 , 5 ] P2 ) 5 - phosphatase .
We have examined the OCRL1 gene in eight unrelated patients with OCRL and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in - frame deletion .
Among the new mutations , two nonsense mutations ( R317X and E558X ) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein .
A missense mutation , R483G , was located in the highly conserved PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 5 - phosphatase domain .
Finally , one frameshift mutation , 2799delC , modifies the C - terminal part of OCRL1 , with an extension of six amino acids .
Altogether , 70 % of missense mutations are located in exon 15 , and 52 % of all mutations cluster in exons 11 - 15 .
We also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OCRL1 locus , and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family .
This observation has direct implications for genetic counseling of Lowe syndrome families . .
MEFV - Gene analysis in armenian patients with Familial Mediterranean fever : diagnostic value and unfavorable renal prognosis of the M694V homozygous genotype - genetic and therapeutic implications .
Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of Armenian ancestry .
To date , its diagnosis , which can be made only retrospectively , is one of exclusion , based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery .
Renal amyloidosis , prevented by colchicine , is the most severe complication of FMF , a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene .
To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV - gene analysis , we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic - linkage analysis .
Eight mutations , one of which ( R408Q ) is new , were found to account for 93 % of the 163 independent FMF alleles , with both FMF alleles identified in 89 % of the patients .
In several instances , family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype .
The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis , compared with other genotypes ( P = . 0002 and P = . 006 , respectively ) .
The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF - including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families .
Noninvasive test for fragile X syndrome , using hair root analysis .
Identification of the FMR1 gene and the repeat - amplification mechanism causing fragile X syndrome led to development of reliable DNA - based diagnostic methods , including Southern blot hybridization and PCR .
Both methods are performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells and measure the repeat size in FMR1 .
Using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears , we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with fragile X syndrome .
This method , also called " antibody test , " uses monoclonal antibodies against the FMR1 gene product ( FMRP ) and is based on absence of FMRP in patients cells .
Here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with fragile X syndrome , on the basis of lack of FMRP in their hair roots .
Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP - specific antibody test , and the percentage of FMRP - expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined .
Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root , whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots .
Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots ( < 55 % ) , and no overlap with normal female controls was observed .
The advantages of this test are ( 1 ) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient , ( 2 ) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center , and ( 3 ) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking .
In addition , this test enabled us to identify two fragile X patients who did not show the full mutation by analysis of DNA isolated from blood cells . .
In Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer , linkage to the HPC1 locus on chromosome 1q24 - 25 is restricted to families with early - onset prostate cancer .
Prostate cancer clusters in some families , and an estimated 5 % - 10 % of all cases are estimated to result from inheritance of prostate cancer - susceptibility genes .
We previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24 - 25 region ( HPC1 ) in 91 North American and Swedish families each with multiple cases of prostate cancer ( Smith et al . 1996 ) .
In the present report we analyze 40 ( 12 original and 28 newly identified ) Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer ( HPC ) that , on the basis of 40 markers spanning a 25 - cM interval within 1q24 - 25 , have evidence of linkage .
In the complete set of families , a maximum two - point LOD score of 1 .
10 was observed at D1S413 ( at a recombination fraction [ theta ] of . 1 ) , with a maximum NPL ( nonparametric linkage ) Z score of 1 .
64 at D1S202 ( P = . 05 ) .
The evidence of linkage to this region originated almost exclusively from the subset of 12 early - onset ( age < 65 years ) families , which yielded a maximum LOD score of 2 .
38 at D1S413 ( straight theta = 0 ) and an NPL Z score of 1 .
95 at D1S422 ( P = . 03 ) .
Estimates from heterogeneity tests suggest that , within Sweden , as many as 50 % of early - onset families had evidence of linkage to the HPC1 region .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis of linkage to HPC1 in a subset of families with prostate cancer , particularly those with an early age at diagnosis .
Molecular basis of feline beta - glucuronidase deficiency : an animal model of mucopolysaccharidosis VII .
A family of domestic cats was found that exhibited clinical and biochemical abnormalities consistent with mucopolysaccharidosis VII , an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by beta - glucuronidase deficiency .
beta - Glucuronidase activity was undetectable in affected cat fibroblasts and restored by retroviral gene transfer of rat beta - glucuronidase cDNA .
beta - Glucuronidase mRNA was normal in affected cat testis by Northern blot analysis .
Normal feline beta - glucuronidase cDNA was cloned and characterized , and amplified from affected cat fibroblasts by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction .
There was a G - to - A transition in the affected cat cDNA that predicted an E351K substitution , destroyed a BssSI site , and eliminated GUSB enzymatic activity in expression studies .
Multiple species comparison and the crystal structure of human beta - glucuronidase indicated that E351 is a highly conserved residue most likely essential in maintenance of the enzymes conformation .
BssSI digestion of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA indicated that affected cats were homozygous and cats with half - normal beta - glucuronidase activity were heterozygous for the missense mutation .
Carriers identified in this manner produced affected kittens in prospective breedings , and a feline MPS VII breeding colony has been established . .
A common molecular basis for rearrangement disorders on chromosome 22q11 .
The chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors .
Three congenital anomaly disorders , cat - eye syndrome , der ( ) syndrome and velo - cardio - facial syndrome / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCFS / DGS ) are associated with tetrasomy , trisomy or monosomy , respectively , for part of chromosome 22q11 .
VCFS / DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements .
In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end - points in a large number of VCFS / DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis .
Most VCFS / DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 .
5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations .
The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements .
To investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster - human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS / DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed LCR22s .
To support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS / DGS patients .
We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders .
We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease .
Functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies .
The early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination .
This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 ( Egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation .
Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot - Marie - Tooth type 1 , Dejerine - Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy .
Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA - binding domain .
The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( R1 ) that binds the NAB transcriptional co - repressors .
A combination of DNA - binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations .
The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity .
The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co - repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity .
These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . .
Autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus with continued secretion of mutant weakly active vasopressin .
Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by post - natal development of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) deficiency due to mutations in the AVP gene .
All published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin - II carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone , leading to neuronal damage .
We studied an unusual Palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus , suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance .
All three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation ( C301 - > T ) in exon 1 , replacing Pro7 of mature AVP with Leu ( Leu - AVP ) .
Leu - AVP was a weak agonist with approximately 30 - fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor .
Measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic Leu - AVP standard , serum Leu - AVP levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal .
The youngest child ( 2 years old ) was only mildly affected but had Leu - AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8 - year - old brother , suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children . .
X inactivation and somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying a Piga - null mutation .
A somatic mutation in the X linked PIGA gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria .
No inherited form of GPI - anchor deficiency has been described .
Because conventional Piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice , we used the Cre / loxP system .
We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2 .
After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa - cre strain , the floxed allele undergoes Cre - mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development .
Because of X chromosome inactivation , female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI - linked proteins .
Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart , lung , kidney , brain , and liver , mainly wild - type Piga is active , suggesting that these tissues require GPI - linked proteins .
The salient exceptions were spleen , thymus , and red blood cells , which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild - type or the recombined allele , implying that GPI - linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues .
PIGA ( - ) cells had no growth advantage , suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . .
The C282Y mutation causing hereditary hemochromatosis does not produce a null allele .
Targeted mutagenesis was used to produce two mutations in the murine hemochromatosis gene ( Hfe ) locus .
The first mutation deletes a large portion of the coding sequence , generating a null allele .
The second mutation introduces a missense mutation ( C282Y ) into the Hfe locus , but otherwise leaves the gene intact .
This mutation is identical to the disease - causing mutation in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis .
Mice carrying each of the two mutations were bred and analyzed .
Homozygosity for either mutation results in postnatal iron loading .
The effects of the null mutation are more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation .
Mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulate more iron than normal controls .
Interestingly , although liver iron stores are greatly increased , splenic iron is decreased .
We conclude that the C282Y mutation does not result in a null allele . .
Genotype - phenotype analysis in X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and identification of a missense mutation associated with a milder phenotype .
Direct sequencing of the emerin gene in 22 families with Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EMD ) revealed mutations in 21 ( 95 % ) , confirming that emerin mutations can be identified in the majority of families with X - linked EMD .
Most emerin mutations result in absence of the protein .
In this study three mutations ( a missense mutation Pro183Thr and two in - frame deletions removing residues 95 - 99 and 236 - 241 , respectively ) were unusual in being associated with expression of mutant protein .
The phenotype in these families was compared in detail with the clinical features in cases with typical null mutations .
For the in - frame deletions there were no significant differences .
In the family with the missense mutation the phenotype was milder .
Age at onset was later for first symptoms and for development of ankle contractures and muscle weakness .
These findings have diagnostic implications as well as pointing to functionally important regions of the emerin protein . .
Severe clinical expression in X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy .
X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset , course and severity .
In the present study , a TCTAC deletion spanning the nucleotides 631 - 635 of the emerin gene caused an unusually severe disease phenotype including loss of ambulation and severe muscle wasting in two affected brothers .
The same mutation has been reported previously in an unrelated family showing a significantly milder phenotype .
The interfamilial heterogeneity in distribution and in severity of the features in the two families point to environmental or genetic modification as the cause of clinical variability in Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy . .
Common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in Jewish men .
BACKGROUND Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer , and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 , appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives .
We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer .
METHODS We examined genomic DNA from 83 ( for BRCA1 185delAG ) or 82 ( for BRCA2 6174delT ) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients , most of whom were treated at a relatively young age , for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population .
RESULTS Our study should have been able to detect a 4 - 5 - fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 .
However , only one ( 1 . 15 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 - 3 . 6 % ) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele , and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation ( 2 . 4 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 - 6 . 2 % ) .
CONCLUSIONS The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence ( about 1 % ) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population .
This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers , mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer
Beta - catenin accumulation and mutation of the CTNNB1 gene in hepatoblastoma .
Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years .
Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this tumor type in families affected by adenomatous polyposis coli .
In addition to the epidemiologic data , molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis .
A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta - catenin , a transcription - activating protein with oncogenic potential .
In an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta - catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli , we observed increased beta - catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas .
Sequencing of exon 3 of the beta - catenin gene ( CTNNB1 ) revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor samples .
Our data indicate for the first time that beta - catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of hepatoblastoma and that activating mutations of the beta - catenin gene may substitute biallelic APC inactivation in this tumor type .
Genes Chromosomes Cancer 25 399 - 402 , 1999 . .
Decrease in GTP cyclohydrolase I gene expression caused by inactivation of one allele in hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation .
Hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation ( HPD ; dopa - responsive dystonia , DRD ) have been recently found to be caused by a genetic defect in the GTP cyclohydrolase I ( GCH1 ) gene .
In this study , we quantified the mRNA level of GCH1 in phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) - stimulated mononuclear blood cells from one Japanese family that do not have a mutation in the coding region or splice junctions of the gene .
The results showed that the amounts of the GCH1 mRNA were decreased to about 40 % of the normal level in both patients and carriers .
In addition , we found that the GCH1 mRNA was transcribed from only one allele , indicating that the other allele was in an inactive state .
These results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the GCH1 gene , and may decrease the GCH1 mRNA causing the HPD / DRD symptoms . .
Sulfate transport is not impaired in pendred syndrome thyrocytes .
Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness , characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory - neural deafness .
The gene responsible for the disease ( PDS ) has been cloned , but its function is as yet unknown and the connection between thyroid goiter and sensory - neural deafness remains an enigma .
PDS codes for a novel protein , pendrin , which is closely related to a number of sufate transporters .
Mechanisms by which abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification have been proposed .
We tested sulfate transport in thyrocytes obtained from Pendred syndrome patients and found that it was not defective .
This suggests that pendrin in fact may not be a sulfate transporter , and emphasizes the importance of functional studies on this novel protein . .
Small deletions in the type II collagen triple helix produce kniest dysplasia .
Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe type II collagenopathy , characterized by short trunk and limbs , kyphoscoliosis , midface hypoplasia , severe myopia , and hearing loss .
Mutations in the gene that encodes type II collagen ( COL2A1 ) , the predominant protein of cartilage , have been identified in a number of individuals with Kniest dysplasia .
All but two of these previously described mutations cause in - frame deletions in type II collagen , either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations .
Furthermore , all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the COL2A1 gene .
We used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with Kniest dysplasia .
Sequencing of the index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations in COL2A1 that result in Kniest dysplasia a 21 - bp deletion in exon 16 , an 18 - bp deletion in exon 19 , and 4 - bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20 .
A previously described 28 - bp deletion at the COL2A1 exon 12 - intron 12 junction , deleting the splice donor site , was identified in the fifth case .
The latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant allele .
These data suggest that Kniest dysplasia results from shorter type II collagen monomers , and support the hypothesis that alteration of a specific COL2A1 domain , which may span from exons 12 to 24 , leads to the Kniest dysplasia phenotype . .
Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) gene .
Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the GALT gene .
The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide .
The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D .
Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent .
Overall , it accounts for 60 - 70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations .
Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems .
Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25 - 40 % of mutant chromosomes .
It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype .
S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans .
In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues .
Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity .
N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles .
N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems .
However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals .
It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities .
The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia .
The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .
Mutations of the VHL gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma : definition of a risk factor for VHL patients to develop an RCC .
To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) mutations , we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene , using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and single - strand conformational polymorphism analysis ( SSCP ) of DNA .
We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples .
After sequencing , we identified microdeletions in 58 % of cases , microinsertions in 17 % , nonsense mutations in 8 % , and missense mutations in 17 % .
Among these mutations , 50 % correspond to new mutations .
VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) subtype , as previously reported .
To compare somatic and germline mutations , we used the VHL database , which includes 507 mutations .
The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78 % of somatic mutations vs only 37 % in germline mutations ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC .
This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations .
We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families , based on the nature of mutations .
We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77 % of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55 % in cases with missense mutations ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Thus , mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of RCC in VHL patients
Defective CTLA - 4 cycling pathway in Chediak - Higashi syndrome : a possible mechanism for deregulation of T lymphocyte activation .
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( CTLA - 4 , also known as CD152 ) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of T cell activation .
Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway .
Chediak - Higashi syndrome ( CHS ) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene , LYST .
It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes , and it is associated with a variety of features , including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis .
The murine equivalent of CHS , beige mice , present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome .
We show herein that CTLA - 4 is present in enlarged , abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation , whereas its surface expression is not impaired .
It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA - 4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease .
This observation may provide insight into the role of CTLA - 4 in humans . .
Proteolipoprotein gene analysis in 82 patients with sporadic Pelizaeus - Merzbacher Disease : duplications , the major cause of the disease , originate more frequently in male germ cells , but point mutations do not .
The Clinical European Network on Brain Dysmyelinating Disease .
Pelizaeus - Merzbacher Disease ( PMD ) is an X - linked developmental defect of myelination affecting the central nervous system and segregating with the proteolipoprotein ( PLP ) locus .
Investigating 82 strictly selected sporadic cases of PMD , we found PLP mutations in 77 % ; complete PLP - gene duplications were the most frequent abnormality ( 62 % ) , whereas point mutations in coding or splice - site regions of the gene were involved less frequently ( 38 % ) .
We analyzed the maternal status of 56 cases to determine the origin of both types of PLP mutation , since this is relevant to genetic counseling .
In the 22 point mutations , 68 % of mothers were heterozygous for the mutation , a value identical to the two - thirds of carrier mothers that would be expected if there were an equal mutation rate in male and female germ cells .
In sharp contrast , among the 34 duplicated cases , 91 % of mothers were carriers , a value significantly ( chi2 = 9 . 20 , P < . 01 ) in favor of a male bias , with an estimation of the male / female mutation frequency ( k ) of 9 .
3 3 .
Moreover , we observed the occurrence of de novo mutations between parental and grandparental generations in 17 three - generation families , which allowed a direct estimation of the k value ( k = 11 ) .
Again , a significant male mutation imbalance was observed only for the duplications .
Chromosome breakage in the Prader - Willi and Angelman syndromes involves recombination between large , transcribed repeats at proximal and distal breakpoints .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4 - Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11 - q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis , respectively .
At a de novo frequency of approximately .
67 - 1 / 10 , 000 births , these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome .
To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events , we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster .
Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions .
Analyses of rodent - human somatic - cell hybrids , YAC contigs , and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences ( the END repeats ) at or near the breakpoints .
The END - repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene ( HERC2 ) , many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues .
One of five PWS / AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable , rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event .
We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11 - q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion .
Furthermore , we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process .
Linkage analysis in a large Brazilian family with van der Woude syndrome suggests the existence of a susceptibility locus for cleft palate at 17p11 . 2 - 11 . 1 .
van der Woude syndrome ( VWS ) , which has been mapped to 1q32 - 41 , is characterized by pits and / or sinuses of the lower lip , cleft lip / palate ( CL / P ) , cleft palate ( CP ) , bifid uvula , and hypodontia ( H ) .
The expression of VWS , which has incomplete penetrance , is highly variable .
Both the occurrence of CL / P and CP within the same genealogy and a recurrence risk < 40 % for CP among descendants with VWS have suggested that the development of clefts in this syndrome is influenced by modifying genes at other loci .
To test this hypothesis , we have conducted linkage analysis in a large Brazilian kindred with VWS , considering as affected the individuals with CP , regardless of whether it is associated with other clinical signs of VWS .
Our results suggest that a gene at 17p11 .
2 - 11 2 - 11 .
1 , together with the VWS gene at 1p32 - 41 , enhances the probability of CP in an individual carrying the two at - risk genes .
If this hypothesis is confirmed in other VWS pedigrees , it will represent one of the first examples of a gene , mapped through linkage analysis , which modifies the expression of a major gene .
New mutations , polymorphisms , and rare variants in the ATM gene detected by a novel SSCP strategy .
The gene for ataxia - telangiectasia , ATM , spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA .
ATM mutations are found along the entire gene , with no evidence of a mutational hot spot .
Using DNA as the starting material , we screened the ATM gene in 92 A - T patients , using an optimized single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique that detected all previously known mutations in the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) segments being analyzed .
To expedite screening , we sequentially loaded the SSCP gels with three different sets of PCR products that were pretested to avoid overlapping patterns .
Many of the DNA changes we detected were intragenic polymorphisms .
Of an expected 177 unknown mutations , we detected approximately 70 % , mostly protein truncating mutations ( that would have been detectable by protein truncation testing if RNA starting material had been available ) .
Mutations have now been defined for every exon of the ATM gene .
Herein , we present 35 new mutations and 34 new intragenic polymorphisms or rare variants within the ATM gene .
This is the most comprehensive compilation of ATM polymorphisms assembled to date .
Defining polymorphic sites as well as mutations in the ATM gene will be of great importance in designing automated methods for detecting mutations . .
A novel frameshift mutation in the McLeod syndrome gene in a Japanese family .
We report a novel mutation in the XK gene ( XK ) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome .
A 50 - year - old man showed progressive muscular atrophy , choreic movement , elevated level of serum creatinine kinase , and acanthocytosis .
The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single - base ( T ) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK .
This deletion caused a frameshift in translation , leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408 .
We conclude this single - base deletion causes defective Kx protein , which is responsible for the McLeod phenotype in this patient . .
Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50 - hMre11 - p95 complex and the DNA damage response .
BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers .
Here , it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 , which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95 / nibrin .
Upon irradiation , BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hRad50 .
Formation of irradiation - induced foci positive for BRCA1 , hRad50 , hMre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild - type BRCA1 .
Ectopic expression of wild - type , but not mutated , BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate .
These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50 - hMre11 - p95 complex . .
Relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency : report from the Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study .
OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria ( PKU ) .
METHODOLOGY PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study ( MPKUCS ) .
A total of 84 different mutations were detected , and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals .
Based on previous knowledge about mutation - phenotype associations , 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity ( severe PKU , moderate PKU , mild PKU , and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [ MHP ] ) .
Then , 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications .
The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity .
These patients are considered functionally hemizygous .
RESULTS The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level .
Cognitive performance ( IQ ) was also significantly related to genotype .
The IQ of PAH - deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96 , respectively , whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84 , respectively .
Of the patients with PKU , 92 % had been treated during childhood .
Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations .
Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group .
CONCLUSIONS The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances .
Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU .
The significant relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy . .
Spinal xanthomatosis : a variant of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis .
We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive , mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) .
MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord .
Post - mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns .
An array of genotypes was found in these patients .
We conclude that spinal xanthomatosis is a clinical and radiological separate entity of CTX that should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic myelopathy . .
A transgene insertion creating a heritable chromosome deletion mouse model of Prader - Willi and angelman syndromes .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11 - q13 .
The central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11 - q13 , with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features .
We report here the characterization of a transgene insertion ( Epstein - Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A , LMP2A ) into mouse chromosome 7C , which has resulted in mouse models for PWS and AS dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent .
Epigenotype ( allelic expression and DNA methylation ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene - induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the PWS / AS - homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci .
Because the intact chromosome 7 , opposite the deleted homolog , maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of PWS and AS mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of AS mice , homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism .
This heritable - deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms , phenotypic basis , and investigation of therapeutic approaches for PWS . .
Linkage analysis of 5 novel van der Woude syndrome kindreds to 1q32 - q41 markers further supports locus homogeneity of the disease trait .
van der Woude syndrome ( vWS , MIM 119300 ) is a rare autosomal dominant clefting condition with cardinal features of mucous cysts ( lower - lip pits ) and clefts to the lip and / or palate .
The vWS gene has been assigned to a locus in 1q32 - q41 by linkage analysis and physical mapping .
We have investigated 5 novel vWS families through probands attended for cleft lip and / or palate repair at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Hopital Trousseau , Paris , in order to tentatively refine the genetic map of the vWS region in 1q32 - q41 and possibly identify unlinked pedigrees .
Linkage analysis was carried out to 6 microsatellite markers ( D1S249 , D1S425 , D1S491 , D1S205 , D1S414 , D1S425 ) , yielding a maximum cumulative LOD score of Z = 3 .
27 at theta = 0 .
00 for D1S245 .
The innermost four markers were found to be tightly linked to one another , with no evidence for recombination .
Our results support linkage of vWS within a region of tightly linked markers and do not favour locus heterogeneity of the disease trait .
Null mutation of the murine ATP7B ( Wilson disease ) gene results in intracellular copper accumulation and late - onset hepatic nodular transformation .
The Atp7b protein is a copper - transporting ATPase expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in most other tissues .
Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to Wilson disease , a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build - up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro - logical abnormalities .
Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B , we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants ( null ) for the Wilson disease gene .
The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60 - fold greater than normal by 5 months of age .
An increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney , brain , placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo - zygous mutants , although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient .
Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age .
Progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency .
Copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically .
In summary , inactivation of the murine ATP7B gene produces a form of cirrhotic liver disease that resembles Wilson disease in humans and the toxic milk phenotype in the mouse . .
French Machado - Joseph disease patients do not exhibit gametic segregation distortion : a sperm typing analysis .
Segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders .
On the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of Japanese descent with Machado - Joseph disease ( MJD ) , it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis .
We performed a sperm typing study of five MJD patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379 436 ( 46 . 5 53 . 5 % ) , which does not support meiotic segregation distortion .
To confirm these results , sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker , D14S1050 , closely linked to the MJD1 gene .
Among 910 sperm analyzed , the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50 .
3 % of the samples and the allele linked to the normal chromosome was found in 49 .
6 % of the sperm .
The difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant ( P = 0 . 8423 ) .
Likelihood - based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population .
The previous report on the Japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism ( 987 G / C ) in the wild - type allele .
All of the French patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism .
However , analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the French MJD patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the C / C homozygous Japanese patients .
Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies .
The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia .
The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired - type DNA - binding domain .
The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA - binding subdomains , the N - terminal subdomain ( NTS ) and the C - terminal subdomain ( CTS ) , which bind respective consensus DNA sequences .
The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain .
The insertion , into the NTS , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA - binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA - binding ability of the CTS .
Thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes .
We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly , congenital cataract , Axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice - variant region .
A T - - > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val - - > Asp ( GTC - - > GAC ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region .
Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half . .
Penetrances of BRCA1 1675delA and 1135insA with respect to breast cancer and ovarian cancer .
For genetic counseling and predictive testing in families with inherited breast - ovarian cancer , penetrances and expressions of the underlying mutations should be known .
We have previously reported two BRCA1 founder mutations in the Norwegian population .
Index cases for the present study were found two different ways through a series of consecutive ovarian cancers ( n = 16 ) and through our family cancer clinic ( n = 14 ) .
Altogether , 20 of the patients had BRCA1 1675delA , and 10 had 1135insA .
Their relatives were described with respect to absence / presence of breast and / or ovarian cancer .
Of 133 living female relatives , 83 ( 62 % ) were tested for the presence of a mutation .
No difference , in penetrance and expression , between the two mutations were found , whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were seen .
The overall findings were that disease started to occur at age 30 years and that by age 50 years 48 % of the mutation - carrying women had experienced breast and / or ovarian cancer .
More ovarian cancers than breast cancers were recorded .
Both penetrance and expression ( breast cancer vs . ovarian cancer ) were different from those in reports of the Ashkenazi founder mutations .
Whether the reported differences reflect true differences and / or methodological problems is discussed .
An observed excess of mutation carriers could not be accounted for by methodological problems ; possible explanations were a " true " low penetrance or preferential segregation . .
The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans - associated collagen type Ialpha1 / platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B - chain fusion gene generates a transforming protein that is processed to functional PDGF - BB .
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 ( COLIA1 ) gene to the platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B - chain ( PDGFB ) gene .
To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion protein , we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor - derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7 - PDGFB intron 1 fusion .
Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells .
The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1 / PDGFB - expressing cells but had no effects on control cells .
The presence of dimeric COLIA1 / PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies .
Pulse - chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1 / PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild - type PDGF - BB .
Finally , COLIA1 / PDGFB - expressing cells generated tumors after s .
c c . injection into nude mice , and tumor growth was reduced by treatment with CGP57148B .
We conclude that the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF - BB and the formation of an autocrine loop .
Our findings , thus , suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B .
Identification of a common PEX1 mutation in Zellweger syndrome .
The Zellweger spectrum of disease , encompassing Zellweger syndrome and the progressively milder phenotypes of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease , is due to a failure to form functional peroxisomes .
Cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated that these diseases are genetically heterogeneous , with two - thirds of all patients lying within a single complementation group , CG1 .
Molecular genetic and cell biology studies have shown that PEX1 is deficient in many CG1 patients .
However , previous studies have focused on mildly affected patients and there is still no report of two mutant PEX1 alleles in any Zellweger syndrome patient .
Furthermore , mutations in the PMP70 gene have also been identified in two Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , raising the possibility that CG1 patients may represent a mixture of PEX1 - deficient and PMP70 - deficient individuals .
To address the molecular basis of disease in Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , we examined all 24 PEX1 exons in four patients , including both patients that have mutations in PMP70 .
PEX1 mutations were detected in all four patients , including a 1 - bp insertion ( c . 2097insT ) in exon 13 that was present in three of the four patients .
Subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutation is present in one - half of all CG1 patients and correlates with the Zellweger syndrome phenotype .
As this mutation leads to a loss of protein function its frequency makes it the most common cause of Zellweger syndrome , helping to explain the high percentage of patients that belong to CG1 .
Novel mutations in the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein gene and their effects on transcriptional , translational , and clinical phenotypes .
Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is an X - linked recessive immunodeficiency characterized by thrombocytopenia , eczema , and recurrent infections , and caused by mutations in the WAS protein ( WASP ) gene .
WASP contains several functional domains through which it interacts with proteins involved in intracellular signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton .
In this report , 17 WASP gene mutations were identified , 12 of which are novel .
DNA of affected males and obligate carriers was PCR amplified and analyzed by SSCA , heteroduplex analysis , and direct sequencing .
The effects of the mutations at the mRNA and protein level were ascertained by RT - PCR and Western blot analyses .
All missense mutations were located in exons 1 - 4 .
Most of the nonsense , frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6 - 11 .
Mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mRNAs , a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product .
The presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype .
When one such case was studied by Western blotting , reduced amounts of normal - size WASP were present .
In other cases as well , a correlation was found between the amount of normal or mutant WASP present and the phenotypes of the affected individuals .
No protein was detected in two individuals with severe WAS .
Reduced levels of a normal - size WASP with a missense mutation were seen in two individuals with XLT .
It is concluded that mutation analysis at the DNA level is not sufficient for predicting clinical course .
Studies at the transcript and protein level are needed for a better assessment . .
Aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice .
Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene , leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle .
A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons .
On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene .
Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane .
We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice .
We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury .
To our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo .
Furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations .
This treatment could prove effective in up to 15 % of patients with DMD . .
Loss of the ataxia - telangiectasia gene product causes oxidative damage in target organs .
Ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) is characterized by a markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , increased incidence of cancer , and neurodegeneration , especially of the cerebellar Purkinje cells .
Ionizing radiation oxidizes macromolecules and causes tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
We therefore hypothesized that A - T is due to oxidative damage resulting from loss of function of the A - T gene product .
To assess this hypothesis , we employed an animal model of A - T , the mouse with a disrupted Atm gene .
We show that organs which develop pathologic changes in the Atm - deficient mice are targets of oxidative damage , and that cerebellar Purkinje cells are particularly affected .
These observations provide a mechanistic basis for the A - T phenotype and lay a rational foundation for therapeutic intervention . .
Recessively inherited multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with normal stature , club foot , and double layered patella caused by a DTDST mutation .
We have observed over 25 different mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene ( DTDST ) in association with the recessive disorders achondrogenesis 1B , atelosteogenesis 2 , and diastrophic dysplasia .
The c862t ( R279W ) transition is the most common mutation in non - Finnish patients , but in these disorders it is usually combined with other DTDST mutations .
We had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t ( R279W ) until we analysed DNA from a 36 year old male with tall - normal stature ( 180 cm ) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia .
He was treated for club foot and hip dysplasia at birth .
Skeletal changes consistent with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia , with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella , were recognised during childhood .
Cleft palate , swelling of the ear pinna , and hitch hiker thumb were absent .
He was found to be homozygous , and both healthy parents heterozygous , for the R279W mutation in DTDST , and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of DTDST disorders .
Counselling was given for a recessive disorder , thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring .
Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the COMP ( EDM1 , McKusick 132400 ) and COL9A2 genes ( EDM2 , McKusick 600204 ) .
A few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have autosomal recessive MED ( EDM4 , McKusick 226900 ) .
This observation confirms the existence of this entity and assigns it to the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations at the DTDST locus . .
Homozygosity for a novel DTDST mutation in a child with a ' broad bone - platyspondylic ' variant of diastrophic dysplasia .
Atypical or variant forms of well - known chondrodysplasias may pose diagnostic problems .
We report on a girl with clinical features suggesting diastrophic dysplasia but with unusual radiographic features including severe platyspondyly , wide metaphyses , and fibular overgrowth , which are partially reminiscent of metatropic dysplasia .
The diagnosis was clarified by molecular analysis of the DTDST gene , which revealed homozygosity for a previously undescribed mutation leading to a Q454P substitution in the 10th transmembrane domain of the DTDST sulfate transporter .
Molecular analysis may be of particular value in such atypical cases . .
The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation : a new facet to Knudson ' s ' two - hit ' hypothesis .
APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene .
Truncating germline and somatic mutations ( or , infrequently , allelic loss ) occur in tumors in FAP ( familial adenomatous polyposis ) .
Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations .
Clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250 - 1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function .
We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194 - 1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other FAP patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region .
Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages , with mutations close to codon 1 , 300 providing the greatest advantage .
Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1 , 300 .
A different germline - somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids .
APC is not , therefore , a classical tumor suppressor .
Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors , the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow . .
Mxi1 mutations in human neurofibrosarcomas .
Mxi1 is thought to negatively regulate Myc function and may therefore be a potential tumor suppressor gene .
Little effort has yet been made to find alterations involving this gene in human solid tumors .
We screened 31 human gastric cancers , 7 esophageal cancers , 85 bone and soft tissue tumors of various types , including 4 neurofibrosarcomas .
We also examined 29 human tumor cell lines consisting of 12 esophageal cancers , 7 glioma / glioblastomas and 10 others for Mxi1 mutations in exons 1 , 2 , 4 ( HLH domain ) , 5 and 6 .
Polymerase chain reaction - single - strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR - SSCP ) and subsequent sequencing revealed three distinct polymorphisms in the intron - exon boundary upstream from exon 6 .
We discovered a missense mutation , GCA to GTA ( Ala 54 Val ) , in exon 2 in a neurofibrosarcoma patient ( case 1 ) , two missense mutations , AAA to CAA ( Lys 118 Gln ) and GAA to GGA ( Glu 154 Gly ) in exon 5 of another neurofibrosarcoma patient ( case 2 ) , and 3 amino acid substitutions , GTG to GCG ( Val 179 Ala ) , GTT to GCT ( Val 181 Ala ) and TTC to CTC ( Phe 186 Leu ) , in a third neurofibrosarcoma patient ( case 3 ) .
In case 3 , loss of heterozygosity was also demonstrated by informative ( TTC ) 3 / ( TTC ) 2 polymorphism .
Our data demonstrate that mutations occur in the Mxi1 gene in neurofibrosarcoma .
Missense mutations in the functional domain of Mxi1 in these cases may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurofibrosarcoma . .
A population - based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene .
BACKGROUND AND METHODS Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis ( HFE ) gene on chromosome 6 , elevated serum transferrin saturation , and excess iron deposits throughout the body .
To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene , we conducted a population - based study in Busselton , Australia .
In 1994 , we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation ( which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels ) in 3011 unrelated white adults .
We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin - saturation values ( 45 percent or higher ) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation .
We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher .
The subjects were followed for up to four years .
RESULTS Sixteen of the subjects ( 0 . 5 percent ) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation , and 424 ( 14 . 1 percent ) were heterozygous .
The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous ; in 1 subject it was 43 percent .
Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis , and 12 had not .
Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994 ; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998 , and 1 had a decrease , although the value remained elevated .
The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range .
Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy ; 3 had hepatic fibrosis , and 1 , who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption , had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis .
Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis , such as hepatomegaly , skin pigmentation , and arthritis .
CONCLUSIONS In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry , 0 .
5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene .
However , only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis , and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four - year period .
Large heterozygous deletion masquerading as homozygous missense mutation : a pitfall in diagnostic mutation analysis .
The clinical use of molecular analyses in recessive disorders relies on the exact characterization of both mutant alleles in the affected patient .
This can be problematic when only part of the gene is examined or when relevant DNA alterations are not recognized by standard methods .
We present a child in whom phenylketonuria was apparently caused by homozygosity for the mutation E390G in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene .
However , the clinical severity of the disease was not quite as mild as expected , the mutation was not identified in the father despite confirmed paternity , and the paternal allele showed a highly unusual pattern of polymorphic markers in the PAH gene .
Presence of a large deletion involving exons 9 , 10 and 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was confirmed by long - range PCR .
Diagnostic DNA analyses should include a comprehensive examination of the whole relevant gene in the patient and confirmation of carrier status in both parents . .
Early onset of X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy in a boy with emerin gene deletion .
A boy developed contractures of the Achilles tendons at 3 years and of the postcervical muscles at 7 years , although neither contractures of the elbows nor cardiac abnormality were recognized by the age of 9 years .
Muscle computed tomography scanning revealed changes characteristic of muscle involvement .
Emerin was not detected in the biopsied muscle , and RT - PCR and PCR - based genomic DNA analyses of the emerin gene demonstrated no amplification product in the patient .
These results confirmed the diagnosis of X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) , and reinforce the necessity of molecular genetic diagnosis of the membrane protein emerin in younger patients with possible EDMD before appearance of the typical symptoms , to avoid sudden cardiac death . .
Duchenne / Becker muscular dystrophy : correlation of phenotype by electroretinography with sites of dystrophin mutations .
The dark - adapted electroretinogram ( ERG ) of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD / BMD ) shows a marked reduction in b - wave amplitude .
Genotype - phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position - specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs , those with defects in the central region have a normal b - wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b - wave and oscillatory potentials , and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in DMD / BMD patients .
The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform , Dp260 , in retinal electrophysiology .
We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD / BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position - specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man .
We have found that , in man , a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b - wave amplitude .
Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260 .
Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b - wave phenotype is the mutation position , rather than muscle disease severity .
Forty - six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs , as opposed to 94 % with more distal mutations .
The human genotype - phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C - terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission . .
Cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation in a cell culture model .
The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3 - untranslated region ( 3 - UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown .
Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results .
Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts .
By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3 - UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation .
Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3 - UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci .
We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects .
Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3 - UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3 - UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts .
Genetic analysis and the Cre - loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3 - UTR transcript .
Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3 - UTR .
These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .
Coats ' disease of the retina ( unilateral retinal telangiectasis ) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene : a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis .
Coats disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development ( so - called retinal telangiectasis ) which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation ( exudative retinal detachment ) .
The classical form of Coats disease is almost invariably isolated , unilateral and seen in males .
A female with a unilateral variant of Coats disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease .
Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11 .
2 2 .
Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non - retinal tissue .
We suggest that Coats telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin ( the protein product of the NDP gene ) within the developing retina .
This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis .
Hereditary TP53 codon 292 and somatic P16INK4A codon 94 mutations in a Li - Fraumeni syndrome family .
Li - Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases .
Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers , it has been frequently reported in Li - Fraumeni syndrome .
On the other hand , hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A , which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53 , were observed in some types of cancer .
In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li - Fraumeni syndrome , we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood , and loss of heterozygosity ( homo / hemizygous deletion ) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B / P16INK4A in two tumor tissues .
The propositus had a seminoma , his daughter a medulloblastoma , and one of his healthy cousins , a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation ( AAA - - > ATA ; Lys - - > Ile ) in the peripheral blood cells .
Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene .
In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter , a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation ( GCG - - > GAG ; Ala - - > Glu ) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation .
P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li - Fraumeni syndrome .
No other gene alteration in TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A was observed .
Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene ( seminoma / medulloblastoma ) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis .
The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family . .
A novel mutation in the sodium / iodide symporter gene in the largest family with iodide transport defect .
We previously reported nine children with an autosomally recessive form of congenital hypothyroidism due to an iodide transport defect in a large Hutterite family with extensive consanguinity living in central Canada .
Since the original report , we have diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism by newborn TSH screening in 9 additional children from the family .
We performed direct sequencing of the PCR products of each NIS ( sodium / iodide symporter ) gene exon with flanking introns amplified from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells of the patients .
We identified a novel NIS gene mutation , G395R ( Gly395 - - > Arg ; GGA - - > AGA ) , in 10 patients examined in the present study .
All of the parents tested were heterozygous for the mutation , suggesting that the patients were homozygous .
The mutation was located in the 10th transmembrane helix .
Expression experiments by transfection of the mutant NIS complimentary DNA into COS - 7 cells showed no perchlorate - sensitive iodide uptake , confirming that the mutation is the direct cause of the iodide transport defect in these patients .
A patient who showed an intermediate saliva / serum technetium ratio ( 14 . 0 ; normal , > or = 20 ) and was considered to have a partial or less severe defect in the previous report ( IX - 24 ) did not have a NIS gene mutation .
It is now possible to use gene diagnostics of this unique NIS mutation to identify patients with congenital hypothyroidism due to an iodide transport defect in this family and to determine the carrier state of potential parents for genetic counseling and arranging rapid and early diagnosis of their infants .
Molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus : early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier .
Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait .
In the present study we have analyzed the AVP - neurophysin II ( AVP - NPII ) gene in a Spanish kindred .
Studies were performed on seven members ( four clinically affected ) of the family .
Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon ( Madrid , Spain ) .
The entire coding region of the AVP - NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced .
All affected individuals presented a missense mutation ( G1757 - - > A ) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain .
The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis .
Additionally , one of the asymptomatic relatives ( a girl 8 months old at the time of study ) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later .
The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease , as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI .
Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants . .
Deficit of in vivo mitochondrial ATP production in patients with Friedreich ataxia .
Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , the most common of the inherited ataxias , is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder , characterized clinically by onset before the age of 25 of progressive gait and limb ataxia , absence of deep tendon reflexes , extensor plantar responses , and loss of position and vibration sense in the lower limbs .
FRDA is caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97 % of patients .
The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210 - aa protein , frataxin , which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients .
Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene ( YFH1 ) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron .
Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients .
Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production ( V ( max ) ) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V ( max ) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele .
Our results show that FRDA is a nuclear - encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition . .
Identification of a novel R21X mutation in the liver - type arginase gene ( ARG1 ) in four Portuguese patients with argininemia .
Argininemia is a rare autossomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency in the cytosolic liver - type arginase enzyme ( L - arginine urea - hydrolase ; E . C . 3 . 5 . 3 . 1 ) .
In order to investigate the molecular basis for argininemia in four unrelated Portuguese patients ( two from northern Portugal and two from Madeira Island ) we performed a DNA sequence analysis of all the exons and exon / intron boundaries of the liver - type arginase gene ( ARG1 ) .
All patients were found to be homozygous for a newly identified C - > T transition in codon 21 ( exon 2 ) substituting arginine for a premature stop codon ( R21X CGA to TGA ) and generating a NlaIII restriction site .
Restriction digestion following PCR amplification of ARG1 exon 2 confirmed the presence of the mutation .
Mutation of the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) results in truncation of mRNA expressed in leucocytes in a Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis .
OBJECTIVES A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) .
The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts , prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique .
METHODS An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR - SSCP ) analysis and subsequent sequencing .
Samples of RNA were subjected to reverse transcription PCR ( RT - PCR ) and the product of the proband was amplified with nested primers and sequenced .
RESULTS A homozygous G to A transition at the 5 end of intron 7 was detected in the patient .
In RT - PCR analysis , only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient , whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings .
The sequencing of the patients cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8 .
CONCLUSION The mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mRNA were identical with those of a recently reported Italian patient , although different in symptomatology .
The application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique on analysing a constructive abnormality of CYP27 mRNA . .
Clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 Wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in WFS1 .
Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile - onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy .
mtDNA deletions have been described , and a gene ( WFS1 ) recently has been identified , on chromosome 4p16 , encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein .
Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the WFS1 gene in 30 patients from 19 British kindreds with Wolfram syndrome .
DNA was also screened for structural rearrangements ( deletions and duplications ) and point mutations in mtDNA .
No pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found in our cohort .
We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene 8 nonsense mutations , 8 missense mutations , 3 in - frame deletions , 1 in - frame insertion , and 4 frameshift mutations .
Of these , 23 were novel mutations , and most occurred in exon 8 .
The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations , and there was no common founder mutation .
The data were also analyzed for genotype - phenotype relationships .
Although some interesting cases were noted , consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear - cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity .
There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters .
Hence , molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome - carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons . .
Late - onset familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) : a subset with distinct clinical , demographic , and molecular genetic characteristics .
To determine the prevalence and characterize demographic , clinical , and genetic features of familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) of late onset , all patients experiencing their first FMF attack at age 40 years or more were identified using the computerized registry of our FMF clinic , and then thoroughly interviewed and examined .
The control group consisted of 40 consecutive FMF patients , who arrived at the FMF clinic for their regular follow - up visit and were 40 years of age or older at the time of the examination .
The severity of the disease in patients and controls was determined using a modified score , developed previously .
Mutational analysis in the FMF gene was performed using a commercial kit .
Only 20 of 4000 ( 0 . 5 % ) patients had late - onset FMF .
These patients were mostly men , of non - North African origin , P < 0 .

A highly accurate , low cost test for BRCA1 mutations .
The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations .
However , the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns the fear of loss of health and life insurance , the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result , and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations .
We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning , based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis .
The efficiency of this system , as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations , was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women , 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1 .
All 14 mutations were identified , as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection .
In addition to the 19 mutations , a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored , most of which were recurring .
All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing .
The cost of screening per sample was calculated to be approximately US $ 70 for the manual technique used in this study , and may be reduced to approximately US $ 10 with the introduction of commercially available PCR robotics and fluorescent imaging .
Implementation of this method of mutation screening in the research and clinical setting should permit rapid accrual of quantitative data on genotype - phenotype associations for the evaluation of diagnostic testing . .
Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 in a boy with a normal karyotype .
We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 ( UPD ( 14 ) ) .
At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .
He showed short stature , obesity , mild developmental delay , cryptorchidism , and some mild dysmorphic features .
The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy .
His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth .
After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking , for which gavage feeding was needed .
Motor development was delayed .
After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite .
Recurrent middle ear infections , a high pain threshold , and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported .
There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance .
Chromosomal analysis was normal ( 46 , XY ) .
DNA analysis for Prader - Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities .
Two years later he was re - examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS - like phenotype associated with maternal UPD ( 14 ) .
At that time precocious puberty was evident .
DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14 .
In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD ( 14 ) , a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis .
This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD ( 14 ) based on clinical features .
This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD ( 14 ) in patients with a similar PWS - like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 . .
Clinical and genetic study of Friedreich ataxia in an Australian population .
Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the FRDA gene that encodes a 210 - amino acid protein called frataxin .
An expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene is present in more than 95 % of mutant alleles .
Of the 83 people we studied who have mutations in FRDA , 78 are homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat ; the other five patients have an expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other .
Here we present a detailed clinical and genetic study of a subset of 51 patients homozygous for an expansion of the GAA repeat .
We found a correlation between the size of the smaller of the two expanded alleles and age at onset , age into wheelchair , scoliosis , impaired vibration sense , and the presence of foot deformity .
There was no significant correlation between the size of the smaller allele and cardiomyopathy , diabetes mellitus , loss of proprioception , or bladder symptoms .
The larger allele size correlated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot deformity .
The duration of disease is correlated with wheelchair use and the presence of diabetes , scoliosis , bladder symptoms and impaired proprioception , and vibration sense but no other complications studied . .
Novel mutations in XLRS1 causing retinoschisis , including first evidence of putative leader sequence change .
Juvenile retinoschisis is an X - linked recessive disease caused by mutations in the XLRS1 gene .
We screened 31 new unrelated patients and families for XLRS1 mutations in addition to previously reported mutations for 60 of our families ( Retinoschisis Consortium , Hum Mol Genet 1998 ; 7 1185 - 1192 ) .
Twenty - three different mutations including 12 novel ones were identified in 28 patients .
Mutations identified in this study include 19 missense mutations , two nonsense mutations , one intragenic deletion , four microdeletions , one insertion , and one intronic sequence substitution that is likely to result in a splice site defect .
Two novel mutations , c .
38T - - > C ( L13P ) and c .
667T - - > C ( C223R ) , respectively , present the first genetic evidence for the functional significance of the putative leader peptide sequence and for the functional significance at the carboxyl terminal of the XLRS1 protein beyond the discoidin domain .
Mutations in 25 of the families were localized to exons 4 - 6 , emphasizing the critical functional significance of the discoidin domain of the XLRS1 protein
Growth hormone treatment increases CO ( 2 ) response , ventilation and central inspiratory drive in children with Prader - Willi syndrome .
We studied whether the beneficial effects of growth hormone ( GH ) treatment on growth and body composition in PWS are accompanied by an improvement in respiratory function .
We measured resting ventilation , airway occlusion pressure ( P ( 0 . 1 ) ) and ventilatory response to CO ( 2 ) in nine children , aged 7 - 14 years , before and 6 - 9 months after the start of GH treatment .
During GH treatment , resting ventilation increased by 26 % , P ( 0 . 1 ) by 72 % and the response to CO ( 2 ) by 65 % ( P < 0 . 002 , < 0 . 04 and < 0 . 02 , respectively ) .
This observed increase in ventilatory output was not correlated to changes in body mass index .
CONCLUSION Treatment of children with Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) seems to have a stimulatory effect on central respiratory structures .
The observed increase in ventilation and inspiratory drive may contribute to the improved activity level reported by parents of PWS children during growth hormone therapy
G130V , a common FRDA point mutation , appears to have arisen from a common founder .
Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) is the most common inherited ataxia .
About 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the affected gene , FRDA .
The other 2 % are point mutations .
Of the 17 point mutations so far described , three appear to be more common .
One of these is the G130V mutation in exon 4 of FRDA .
G130V , when present with an expanded GAA repeat on the other allele , is associated with an atypical FRDA phenotype .
Haplotype analysis was undertaken on the four families who have been described with this mutation .
The results suggest a common founder for this mutation .
Although marked differences in extragenic marker haplotypes were seen in one family , similar intragenic haplotyping suggests the same mutation founder for this family with the differences explicable by two recombination events . .
Synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of the FMR1 gene .
Most fragile X syndrome patients have expansion of a ( CGG ) ( n ) sequence with > 200 repeats ( full mutation ) in the FMR1 gene responsible for this condition .
Hypermethylation of the expanded repeat and of the FMR1 promoter is almost always present and apparently suppresses transcription , resulting in absence of the FMR1 protein .
We recently showed that transcriptional reactivation of FMR1 full mutations can be achieved by inducing DNA demethylation with 5 - azadeoxycytidine ( 5 - azadC ) .
The level of histone acetylation is another important factor in regulating gene expression ; therefore , we treated lymphoblastoid cell lines of non - mosaic full mutation patients with three drugs capable of inducing histone hyperacetylation .
We observed a consistent , although modest , reactivation of the FMR1 gene with 4 - phenylbutyrate , sodium butyrate and trichostatin A , as shown by RT - PCR .
However , we report that combining these drugs with 5 - azadC results in a 2 - to 5 - fold increase in FMR1 mRNA levels obtained with 5 - azadC alone , thus showing a marked synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of FMR1 full mutations . .
Constitutional von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) gene deletions detected in VHL families by fluorescence in situ hybridization .
von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of tumor types that include retinal hemangioblastomas , hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system , renal cell carcinomas , pancreatic cysts and tumors , pheochromocytomas , endolymphatic sac tumors , and epididymal cystadenomas [ W .

455 - 473 , McGraw - Hill , 1998 ] .
The VHL gene was localized to chromosome 3p25 - 26 and cloned [ F . Latif et al . , Science ( Washington DC ) , 260 1317 - 1320 , 1993 ] .
Germline mutations in the VHL gene have been detected in the majority of VHL kindreds .
The reported frequency of detection of VHL germline mutations has varied from 39 to 80 % ( J . M . Whaley et al . , Am . J . Hum . Genet . , 55 1092 - 1102 , 1994 ; Clinical Research Group for Japan , Hum . Mol . Genet . , 4 2233 - 2237 , 1995 ; F . Chen et al . , Hum . Mutat . , 5 66 - 75 , 1995 ; E . R . Maher et al . , J . Med . Genet . , 33 328 - 332 , 1996 ; B . Zbar , Cancer Surv . , 25 219 - 232 , 1995 ) .
Recently a quantitative Southern blotting procedure was found to improve this frequency ( C . Stolle et al . , Hum . Mutat . , 12 417 - 423 , 1998 ) .
In the present study , we report the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) as a method to detect and characterize VHL germline deletions .
We reexamined a group of VHL patients shown previously by single - strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the VHL locus .
We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus .
We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion - free .
In addition , germline mosaicism of the VHL gene was identified in one family .
In sum , FISH was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect VHL germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a VHL gene abnormality
Spectrum of hSNF5 / INI1 somatic mutations in human cancer and genotype - phenotype correlations .
The hSNF5 / INI1 gene which encodes a member of the SWI / SNF chromatin ATP - dependent remodeling complex , is a new tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11 .
2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant rhabdoid tumors .
We have searched for hSNF5 / INI1 mutations in 229 tumors of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high - performance liquid chromatography .
A total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified .
Point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense , 15 frameshift , three splice site , two missense and one editing mutations .
Mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors , whatever their sites of occurrence , indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors .
Recurrent hSNF5 / INI1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors ( cPNETs ) and medulloblastomas .
In contrast , hSNF5 / INI1 point mutations were not detected in breast cancers , Wilms tumors , gliomas , ependymomas , sarcomas and other tumor types , even though most analyzed cases harbored loss of heterozygosity at 22q11 .
2 loci .
These results suggest that rhabdoid tumors , choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cPNETs share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hSNF5 / INI1 alteration and that hSNF5 / INI1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently , but not always , exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype
Ataxin - 3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix .
Spinocerebellar ataxia type - 3 or Machado - Joseph disease ( SCA3 / MJD ) is a member of the CAG / polyglutamine repeat disease family .
In this family of disorders , a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded , resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product .
Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis ; however , the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear .
Here we demonstrate that ataxin - 3 , the disease protein in SCA3 / MJD , adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells .
The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine , but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin - 3 containing a normal glutamine repeat .
In addition , expression of ataxin - 3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full - length non - pathological protein , allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2 .
Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin - 3 is not due to proteolysis , suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein ( s ) alters the structure of full - length ataxin - 3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain .
This conformationally altered ataxin - 3 is bound to the nuclear matrix .
The pathological form of ataxin - 3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix .
These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3 / MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin - 3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain . .
The human MAGEL2 gene and its mouse homologue are paternally expressed and mapped to the Prader - Willi region .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a complex neurogenetic disorder .
The phenotype is likely to be a contiguous gene syndrome involving genes which are paternally expressed only , located in the human 15q11 - q13 region .
Four mouse models of PWS have been reported but these do not definitively allow the delineation of the critical region and the associated genes involved in the aetiology of PWS .
Moreover , targeted mutagenesis of mouse homologues of the human candidate PWS genes does not appear to result in any of the features of PWS .
Therefore , the isolation of new genes in this region remains crucial for a better understanding of the molecular basis of PWS .
In this manuscript , we report the characterization of MAGEL2 and its mouse homologue Magel2 .
These are located in the human 15q11 - q13 and mouse 7C regions , in close proximity to NDN / Ndn .
By northern blot analysis we did not detect any expression of MAGEL2 / Magel2 but by RT - PCR analysis , specific expression was detected in fetal and adult brain and in placenta .
Both genes are intronless with tandem direct repeat sequences contained within a CpG island in the 5 - untranscribed region .
The transcripts encode putative proteins that are homologous to the MAGE proteins and NDN .
Moreover , MAGEL2 / Magel2 are expressed only from the paternal allele in brain , suggesting a potential role in the aetiology of PWS and its mouse model , respectively . .
cDNA microarrays detect activation of a myogenic transcription program by the PAX3 - FKHR fusion oncogene .
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle characterized in 60 % of cases by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) .
This results in the fusion of PAX3 , a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis , with FKHR , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors .
The resultant PAX3 - FKHR gene possesses transforming properties ; however , the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown .
To investigate the actions of these transcription factors , both Pax3 and PAX3 - FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells , and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cDNA microarray containing 2 , 225 elements .
We found that PAX3 - FKHR but not PAX3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors MyoD , Myogenin , Six1 , and Slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function .
Notable among this group were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5 .
Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes ( IGFBP5 , HSIX1 , and Slug ) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines .
This study utilizes cDNA microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of PAX3 - FKHR in NIH 3T3 cells . .
Experimental hemochromatosis due to MHC class I HFE deficiency : immune status and iron metabolism .
The puzzling linkage between genetic hemochromatosis and histocompatibility loci became even more so when the gene involved , HFE , was identified .
Indeed , within the well defined , mainly peptide - binding , MHC class I family of molecules , HFE seems to perform an unusual yet essential function .
As yet , our understanding of HFE function in iron homeostasis is only partial ; an even more open question is its possible role in the immune system .
To advance on both of these avenues , we report the deletion of HFE alpha1 and alpha2 putative ligand binding domains in vivo .
HFE - deficient animals were analyzed for a comprehensive set of metabolic and immune parameters .
Faithfully mimicking human hemochromatosis , mice homozygous for this deletion develop iron overload , characterized by a higher plasma iron content and a raised transferrin saturation as well as an elevated hepatic iron load .
The primary defect could , indeed , be traced to an augmented duodenal iron absorption .
In parallel , measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of HFE in iron homeostasis .
Finally , an extensive phenotyping of primary and secondary lymphoid organs including the gut provides no compelling evidence for an obvious immune - linked function for HFE . .
Somatic rearrangement of chromosome 14 in human lymphocytes .
Ataxia - telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder associated with immune deficiency , chromosome instability , and a predisposition to lymphoid malignancy .
We have detected chromosomally anomalous clones of lymphocytes in eight patients with this disorder .
Chromosome banding disclosed that the clones are consistently marked by structural rearrangement of the long arm ( q ) of chromosome 14 .
A translocation involving 14q was found in clones obtained from seven of the eight patients whereas a ring 14 chromosome was found in a clone obtained from the other .
These findings as well as data obtained by others for patients with ataxia - telangiectasia suggest that structural rearrangement of 14q is the initial chromosomal change in lymphocyte clones of patients with this disorder .
Chromosomes of lymphocytes from one of the patients were studied before and after the onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
Before leukemia was diagnosed , the patient had a lymphocyte clone with a 14q translocation .
This clone appears to have given rise to the leukemic cells .
We hypothesize that structural rearrangement of 14q is directly related to abnormal growth of lymphocytes and that it may be a step toward the development of lymphoid malignancies .
Increasing evidence , provided by others , for the nonrandom involvement of 14q in African - type Burkitts lymphoma and other lymphoid neoplasms further strengthens this hypothesis . .
Exon 9 mutations in the WT1 gene , without influencing KTS splice isoforms , are also responsible for Frasier syndrome .
We report new mutations in exon 9 of the WT1 gene that did not alter the ratio of + / - KTS splice isoforms in two unrelated patients with Frasier syndrome ( FS ) .
The mutation of intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing was reported to be responsible for this syndrome .
The mutations found in our cases occurred in the same exon of the WT1 gene as detected in Denys - Drash syndrome ( DDS ) and could not be explained by the previously proposed mechanism .
The results suggest that the two syndromes originate from the same WT1 gene abnormality .
From a molecular biological point of view , we concluded that the two diseases were not separable , and that FS should be included as an atypical form of DDS . .
Splice - site mutation in the PDS gene may result in intrafamilial variability for deafness in Pendred syndrome .
Pendred syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder that consists of developmental abnormalities of the cochlea , sensorineural hearing loss , and diffuse thyroid enlargement ( goiter ) .
This disorder may account for up to 10 % of cases of hereditary deafness .
The disease gene ( PDS ) has been mapped to chromosome 7q22 - q31 , and encodes a chloride - iodide transport protein .
We performed mutation analysis of individual exons of the PDS gene in one Spanish family that shows intrafamilial variability of the deafness phenotype ( two patients with profound and one with moderate - severe deafness ) .
We identified a new splice - site mutation affecting intron 4 of the PDS gene , at nucleotide position 639 + 7 .
RNA analysis from lymphocytes of the affected patients showed that mutation 639 + 7A - - > G generates a new donor splice site , leading to an mRNA with an insertion of six nucleotides from intron 4 of PDS .
Since the newly created donor splice site is likely to compete with the normal one , variations of the levels of normal and aberrant transcripts of the PDS gene in the cochlea may explain the variability in the deafness presentation . .
The molecular basis of Sjogren - Larsson syndrome : mutation analysis of the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase gene .
Sjogren - Larsson syndrome ( SLS ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis , mental retardation , spasticity , and deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase ( FALDH ) .
To define the molecular defects causing SLS , we performed mutation analysis of the FALDH gene in probands from 63 kindreds with SLS .
Among these patients , 49 different mutations - including 10 deletions , 2 insertions , 22 amino acid substitutions , 3 nonsense mutations , 9 splice - site defects , and 3 complex mutations - were found .
All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations .
Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells , but one mutation ( 798G - - > C [ K266N ] ) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability .
The splice - site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor - splice sites .
Thirty - seven mutations were private , and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent .
Four single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were found in the FALDH gene .
At least four of the common mutations ( 551C - - > T , 682C - - > T , 733G - - > A , and 798 + 1delG ) were associated with multiple SNP haplotypes , suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient SLS genes that had undergone intragenic recombination .
Our results demonstrate that SLS is caused by a strikingly heterogeneous group of mutations in the FALDH gene and provide a framework for understanding the genetic basis of SLS and the development of DNA - based diagnostic tests . .
Loss - of - function mutations in the cathepsin C gene result in periodontal disease and palmoplantar keratosis .
Papillon - Lefevre syndrome , or keratosis palmoplantaris with periodontopathia ( PLS , MIM 245000 ) , is an autosomal recessive disorder that is mainly ascertained by dentists because of the severe periodontitis that afflicts patients .
Both the deciduous and permanent dentitions are affected , resulting in premature tooth loss .
Palmoplantar keratosis , varying from mild psoriasiform scaly skin to overt hyperkeratosis , typically develops within the first three years of life .
Keratosis also affects other sites such as elbows and knees .
Most PLS patients display both periodontitis and hyperkeratosis .
Some patients have only palmoplantar keratosis or periodontitis , and in rare individuals the periodontitis is mild and of late onset .
The PLS locus has been mapped to chromosome 11q14 - q21 ( refs 7 , 8 , 9 ) .
Using homozygosity mapping in eight small consanguineous families , we have narrowed the candidate region to a 1 .
2 - cM interval between D11S4082 and D11S931 .
The gene ( CTSC ) encoding the lysosomal protease cathepsin C ( or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I ) lies within this interval .
We defined the genomic structure of CTSC and found mutations in all eight families .
In two of these families we used a functional assay to demonstrate an almost total loss of cathepsin C activity in PLS patients and reduced activity in obligate carriers .
Confirmation of linkage of Van der Woude syndrome to chromosome 1q32 : evidence of association with STR alleles suggests possible unique origin of the disease mutation .
Van der Woude syndrome ( VWS ) is an autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder with high penetrance and variable expression .
Its clinical features are variably expressed , but include cleft lip and / or cleft palate , lip pits and hypodontia .
All VWS families studied to date map the disease gene to a < 2 cM region of chromosome 1q32 , with no evidence of locus heterogeneity .
The aim of this study is to refine the localization of the VWS gene and to further assess possible heterogeneity .
We analyzed four multiplex VWS families .
All available members were clinically assessed and genotyped for 19 short tandem repeat markers on chromosome 1 in the VWS candidate gene region .
We performed two - point and multipoint limit of detection ( LOD ) score analyses using a high penetrance autosomal dominant model .
All families showed positive LOD scores without any recombination in the candidate region .
The largest two - point LOD score was 5 .
87 87 .
Our assay method for short tandem repeat ( STR ) markers provided highly accurate size estimation of marker allele fragment sizes , and therefore enabled us to determine the specific alleles segregating with the VWS gene in each of our four families .
We observed a striking pattern of STR allele sharing at several closely linked loci among our four Caucasian VWS families recruited at three different locations in the US .
These results suggest the possibility of a unique origin for a mutation responsible for many or most cases of VWS .
A point mutation Thr ( 799 ) Met on the alpha ( 2 ) integrin leads to the formation of new human platelet alloantigen Sit ( a ) and affects collagen - induced aggregation .
A new platelet - specific alloantigen , termed Sit ( a ) , was identified in a severe case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia .
The Sit ( a ) alloantigen is of low frequency ( 1 / 400 ) in the German population .
Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit ( a ) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia .
Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit ( a ) - positive platelets showed C ( 2531 ) - - > T ( 2531 ) point mutation , resulting in Thr ( 799 ) Met dimorphism .
Analysis of genomic DNA from 22 Sit ( a ) - negative normal individuals showed that the Thr ( 799 ) is encoded by ACG ( 2532 ) ( 90 . 9 % ) or ACA ( 2532 ) ( 9 . 1 % ) .
To establish a DNA typing technique , we elucidated the organization of the GPIa gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases .
The introns ( 421 bp and 1 . 2 kb ) encompass a 142 - bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532 .
Polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme Mae III showed that the Met ( 799 ) form of GPIa is restricted to Sit ( a ) ( + ) phenotype .
Analysis of stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele - specific recombinant forms of GPIa showed that anti - Sit ( a ) exclusively reacted with the Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) , but not with the Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) isoforms .
In contrast , anti - Br ( a ) ( HPA - 5b ) only recognized the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) form , whereas anti - Br ( b ) ( HPA - 5a ) reacted with both Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) isoforms .
These results demonstrated that the Met ( 799 ) is responsible for formation of the Sit ( a ) alloantigenic determinants , whereas amino acid 505 ( Lys or Glu ) specifically controls the expression of Br ( a ) and Br ( b ) epitopes , respectively .
Platelet aggregation responses of Sit ( a ) ( + ) individuals were diminished in response to collagen , indicating that the Thr ( 799 ) Met mutation affects the function of the GPIa / IIa complex
Mutations of the cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon - Lefevre syndrome .
Papillon - Lefevre syndrome ( PLS ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions .
A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2 .
8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14 .
Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene ( CTSC ) .
The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes , macrophages , and their precursors .
By RT - PCR , we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS , including the palms , soles , knees , and oral keratinised gingiva .
The 4 .
7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons .
Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations .
An exon 1 nonsense mutation ( 856C - - > T ) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286 .
Three exon 2 mutations were identified , including a single nucleotide deletion ( 2692delA ) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon , a 2 bp deletion ( 2673 - 2674delCT ) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343 , and a G - - > A substitution in codon 429 ( 2931G - - > A ) introducing a premature termination codon .
All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor .
Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS .
A more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin C carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility
Mutational analysis of the HGO gene in Finnish alkaptonuria patients .
Alkaptonuria ( AKU ) , the prototypic inborn error of metabolism , has recently been shown to be caused by loss of function mutations in the homogentisate - 1 , 2 - dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) .
So far 17 mutations have been characterised in AKU patients of different ethnic origin .
We describe three novel mutations ( R58fs , R330S , and H371R ) and one common AKU mutation ( M368V ) , detected by mutational and polymorphism analysis of the HGO gene in five Finnish AKU pedigrees .
The three novel AKU mutations are most likely specific for the Finnish population and have originated recently . .
The identical 5 ' splice - site acceptor mutation in five attenuated APC families from Newfoundland demonstrates a founder effect .
Inherited mutations of the APC gene predispose carriers to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and rectum and to colorectal cancer .
Mutations located at the extreme 5 end of the APC gene , however , are associated with a less severe disease known as attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) .
Many individuals with AAPC develop relatively few colorectal polyps but are still at high risk for colorectal cancer .
We report here the identification of a 5 APC germline mutation in five separately ascertained AAPC families from Newfoundland , Canada .
This disease - causing mutation is a single basepair change ( G to A ) in the splice - acceptor region of APC intron 3 that creates a mutant RNA without exon 4 of APC .
The observation of the same APC mutation in five families from the same geographic area demonstrates a founder effect .
Furthermore , the identification of this germline mutation strengthens the correlation between the 5 location of an APC disease - causing mutation and the attenuated polyposis phenotype . .
Alstrom syndrome : further evidence for linkage to human chromosome 2p13 .
Alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal degeneration , sensorineural hearing loss , early - onset obesity , and non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus .
The gene for Alstrom syndrome ( ALMS1 ) has been previously localized to human chromosome 2p13 by homozygosity mapping in two distinct isolated populations - French Acadian and North African .
Pair - wise analyses resulted in maximum lod ( logarithm of the odds ratio ) scores of 3 .
84 and 2 .
9 , respectively .
To confirm these findings , a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for Alstrom syndrome .
A maximum two - point lod score of 7 .
13 ( theta = 0 . 00 ) for marker D2S2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9 .
16 for marker D2S2110 were observed , further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13 .
No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed in these families .
Meiotic recombination events have localized the critical region containing ALMS1 to a 6 .
1 - cM interval flanked by markers D2S327 and D2S286 .
A fine resolution radiation hybrid map of 31 genes and markers has been constructed .
Pendred syndrome : phenotypic variability in two families carrying the same PDS missense mutation .
Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss , thyroid goiter , and positive perchlorate discharge test .
Recently , this autosomal recessive disorder was shown to be caused by mutations in the PDS gene , which encodes an anion transporter called pendrin .
Molecular analysis of the PDS gene was performed in two consanguineous large families from Southern Tunisia comprising a total of 23 individuals affected with profound congenital deafness ; the same missense mutation , L445W , was identified in all affected individuals .
A widened vestibular aqueduct was found in all patients who underwent computed tomography ( CT ) scan exploration of the inner ear .
In contrast , goiter was present in only 11 affected individuals , who interestingly had a normal result of the perchlorate discharge test whenever performed .
The present results question the sensitivity of the perchlorate test for the diagnosis of Pendred syndrome and support the use of a molecular analysis of the PDS gene in the assessment of individuals with severe to profound congenital hearing loss associated with inner ear morphological anomaly even in the absence of a thyroid goiter . .
Knobloch syndrome involving midline scalp defect of the frontal region .
We report on a 4 - year - old boy with Knobloch syndrome .
He has vitreoretinal degeneration , high myopia , cataract , telecanthus , hypertelorism , and a high - arched palate .
He also has a defect of the anterior midline scalp with involvement of the frontal bone as documented by a computed tomography ( CT ) scan .
The brain was normal on CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging .
We present a review of the 23 published cases with this syndrome .
Our patient illustrates the importance of investigating for underlying ocular and central nervous system pathology whenever midline scalp defects are present . .
The DNA double - strand break repair gene hMRE11 is mutated in individuals with an ataxia - telangiectasia - like disorder .
We show that hypomorphic mutations in hMRE11 , but not in ATM , are present in certain individuals with an ataxia - telangiectasia - like disorder ( ATLD ) .
The cellular features resulting from these hMRE11 mutations are similar to those seen in A - T as well as NBS and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation , radioresistant DNA synthesis , and abrogation of ATM - dependent events , such as the activation of Jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation .
Although the mutant hMre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hRad50 and Nbs1 , formation of ionizing radiation - induced hMre11 and Nbs1 foci was absent in hMRE11 mutant cells .
These data demonstrate that ATM and the hMre11 / hRad50 / Nbs1 protein complex act in the same DNA damage response pathway and link hMre11 to the complex pathology of A - T . .
Mutations in TNFRSF11A , affecting the signal peptide of RANK , cause familial expansile osteolysis .
Familial expansile osteolysis ( FEO , MIM 174810 ) is a rare , autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone remodelling .
The osteolytic lesions , which develop usually in the long bones during early adulthood , show increased osteoblast and osteoclast activity .
Our previous linkage studies mapped the gene responsible for FEO to an interval of less than 5 cM between D18S64 and D18S51 on chromosome 18q21 .
2 - 21 2 - 21 .
3 in a large Northern Irish family .
The gene encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor - kappa B ( RANK ; ref . 5 ) , TNFRSF11A , maps to this region .
RANK is essential in osteoclast formation .
We identified two heterozygous insertion mutations in exon 1 of TNFRSF11A in affected members of four families with FEO or familial Paget disease of bone ( PDB ) .
One was a duplication of 18 bases and the other a duplication of 27 bases , both of which affected the signal peptide region of the RANK molecule .
Expression of recombinant forms of the mutant RANK proteins revealed perturbations in expression levels and lack of normal cleavage of the signal peptide .
Both mutations caused an increase in RANK - mediated nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) signalling in vitro , consistent with the presence of an activating mutation .
Cardiac Na ( + ) channel dysfunction in Brugada syndrome is aggravated by beta ( 1 ) - subunit .
BACKGROUND Mutations in the gene encoding the human cardiac Na ( + ) channel alpha - subunit ( hH1 ) are responsible for chromosome 3 - linked congenital long - QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ) .
An auxiliary beta ( 1 ) - subunit , widely expressed in excitable tissues , shifts the voltage dependence of steady - state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na ( + ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform .
Here , we characterize the altered effects of a human beta ( 1 ) - subunit ( hbeta ( 1 ) ) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation ( T1620M ) previously associated with IVF .
METHODS AND RESULTS When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes , T1620M exhibited no persistent currents , in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels , but the midpoint of steady - state inactivation ( V ( 1 / 2 ) ) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild - type hH1 .
Coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild - type hH1 ; however , it further shifted the V ( 1 / 2 ) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M .
Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal .
CONCLUSIONS It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation ( window current ) in T1620M , which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo .
One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha - / beta ( 1 ) - subunit association in the mutant . .
Meiotic segregation analysis of RB1 alleles in retinoblastoma pedigrees by use of single - sperm typing .
In hereditary retinoblastoma , different epidemiological studies have indicated a preferential paternal transmission of mutant retinoblastoma alleles to offspring , suggesting the occurrence of a meiotic drive .
To investigate this mechanism , we analyzed sperm samples from six individuals from five unrelated families affected with hereditary retinoblastoma .
Single - sperm typing techniques were performed for each sample by study of two informative short tandem repeats located either in or close to the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) .
The segregation probability of mutant RB1 alleles in sperm samples was assessed by use of the SPERMSEG program , which includes experimental parameters , recombination fractions between the markers , and segregation parameters .
A total of 2 , 952 single sperm from the six donors were analyzed .
We detected a significant segregation distortion in the data as a whole ( P = . 0099 ) and a significant heterogeneity in the segregation rate across donors ( . 0092 ) .
Further analysis shows that this result can be explained by segregation distortion in favor of the normal allele in one donor only and that it does not provide evidence of a significant segregation distortion in the other donors .
The segregation distortion favoring the mutant RB1 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis , and , thus , meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms , including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant RB1 gene , or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human X chromosome .
Friedreich ataxia : an overview .
Friedreich ataxia , an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease , is the most common of the inherited ataxias .
The recent discovery of the gene that is mutated in this condition , FRDA , has led to rapid advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia .
About 98 % of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene .
This leads to reduced levels of the protein , frataxin .
There is mounting evidence to suggest that Friedreich ataxia is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals , which then results in cellular damage and death .
Currently there is no known treatment that alters the natural course of the disease .
The discovery of the FRDA gene and its possible function has raised hope that rational therapeutic strategies will be developed . .
X - linked retinoschisis with point mutations in the XLRS1 gene .
BACKGROUND X - linked retinoschisis ( XLRS ) is a relatively rare vitreoretinal dystrophy that causes visual loss in young men .
Recently , a gene responsible for this disease , designated XLRS1 , was identified , and several deleterious gene mutations were reported .
OBJECTIVE To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed as having XLRS formutational changes in the XLRS1 gene .
METHODS Ten patients with XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination , including slitlamp biomicroscopy and dilated funduscopy .
Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes , and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method .
RESULTS Point mutations in the XLRS1 gene were identified in all 10 patients .
The mutations were identical in each of 2 pairs of brothers .
Six of the point mutations represented missense mutations , 1 was a nonsense mutation , and 1 was a frameshift mutation .
Five of the mutations are newly reported herein .
CONCLUSIONS The discovery of new point mutations in this study increases the available information regarding the spectrum of genetic abnormalities and clinical manifestations of XLRS .
However , the limited data failed to reveal a correlation between mutation and disease phenotype .
CLINICAL RELEVANCE Identification of mutations in the XLRS1 gene and expanded information on clinical manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis , appropriate early therapy , and genetic counseling regarding the prognosis of XLRS . .
Atm and Bax cooperate in ionizing radiation - induced apoptosis in the central nervous system .
Ataxia - telangiectasia is a hereditary multisystemic disease resulting from mutations of ataxia telangiectasia , mutated ( ATM ) and is characterized by neurodegeneration , cancer , immune defects , and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation .
The molecular details of ATM function in the nervous system are unclear , although the neurological lesion in ataxia - telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life , suggesting a developmental origin .
The central nervous system ( CNS ) of Atm - null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress , suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage .
Here , we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm - dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation ( IR ) .
Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax - / - and Atm - / - mice were radioresistant , mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR - induced apoptosis in the CNS .
Therefore , although the major IR - induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax , a p53 - dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm - and Bax - independent branches .
Further , Atm - and Bax - dependent apoptosis in the CNS also required caspase - 3 activation .
These data implicate Bax and caspase - 3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways . .
Haim - Munk syndrome and Papillon - Lefevre syndrome are allelic mutations in cathepsin C .
Of the many palmoplantar keratoderma ( PPK ) conditions , only Papillon - Lefevre syndrome ( PLS ) and Haim - Munk syndrome ( HMS ) are associated with premature periodontal destruction .
Although both PLS and HMS share the cardinal features of PPK and severe periodontitis , a number of additional findings are reported in HMS including arachnodactyly , acro - osteolysis , atrophic changes of the nails , and a radiographic deformity of the fingers .
While PLS cases have been identified throughout the world , HMS has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from Cochin , India .
Parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions .
Although autosomal recessive transmission of PLS is evident , a more " complex " autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for HMS .
Recently , mutations of the cathepsin C gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect in PLS .
To determine if a cathepsin C mutation is also responsible for HMS , we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the Cochin isolate in which both the PLS and HMS phenotypes appear .
Here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin C ( exon 6 , 2127A - - > G ) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin C peptide .
This mutation segregates with HMS in four nuclear families .
Additionally , the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin C gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the Cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited " identical by descent " from a common ancestor .
This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families .
We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon ( 2126C - - > T ) in a Turkish family with classical PLS .
These findings provide evidence that PLS and HMS are allelic variants of cathepsin C gene mutations . .
ATM - heterozygous germline mutations contribute to breast cancer - susceptibility .
Approximately 0 .
5 % - 1 % of the general population has been estimated to be heterozygous for a germline mutation in the ATM gene .
Mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) ( MIM 208900 ) .
The finding that ATM - heterozygotes have an increased relative risk for breast cancer was supported by some studies but not confirmed by others .
In view of this discrepancy , we examined the frequency of ATM germline mutations in a selected group of Dutch patients with breast cancer .
We have analyzed ATM germline mutations in normal blood lymphocytes , using the protein - truncation test followed by genomic - sequence analysis .
A high percentage of ATM germline mutations was demonstrated among patients with sporadic breast cancer .
The 82 patients included in this study had developed breast cancer at age < 45 and had survived > / = 5 years ( mean 15 years ) , and in 33 ( 40 % ) of the patients a contralateral breast tumor had been diagnosed .
Among these patients we identified seven ( 8 . 5 % ) ATM germline mutations , of which five are distinct .
One splice - site mutation ( IVS10 - 6T - - > G ) was detected three times in our series .
Four heterozygous carriers were patients with bilateral breast cancer .
Our results indicate that the mutations identified in this study are " A - T disease - causing " mutations that might be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in heterozygotes .
We conclude that ATM heterozygotes have an approximately ninefold - increased risk of developing a type of breast cancer characterized by frequent bilateral occurrence , early age at onset , and long - term survival .
The specific characteristics of our population of patients may explain why such a high frequency was not found in other series .
Human mutations in glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history .
Glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X - linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH , a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions .
Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia ( triggered by fava beans or other agents ) or life - long hemolytic anemia .
We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene .
From the alignment of the amino acid ( aa ) sequence of 52 glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) species from 42 different organisms , we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD two - thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved ( 50 - 99 % ) aa ; relatively few are in fully conserved aa ( where they might be lethal ) or in poorly conserved aa , where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency .
This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development .
Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein .
In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects , this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes . .
Constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) isoforms with distinct properties .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults .
The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3 - untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene , consisting of 15 exons .
Using a transgenic DMPK - overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type - dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns .
Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined .
In contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C - terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle .
We generated all six full - length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full - length ( heart - , skeletal muscle - or brain - specific ) and two C - terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa ( smooth muscle - specific ) isoforms .
Information on DMPK mRNA and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing differential effects of ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion in DM manifestation . .
Genetic analysis , phenotypic diagnosis , and risk of venous thrombosis in families with inherited deficiencies of protein S .
Protein S deficiency is a recognized risk factor for venous thrombosis .
Of all the inherited thrombophilic conditions , it remains the most difficult to diagnose because of phenotypic variability , which can lead to inconclusive results .
We have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level .
Twenty - eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied , together with 109 first - degree relatives .
To avoid selection bias , we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives .
In this group of relatives , a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect ( sensitivity 97 . 7 % , specificity 100 % ) .
First - degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5 .
0 - fold higher risk of thrombosis ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 5 - 16 . 8 ) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect .
Although pregnancy / puerperium and immobility / trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis , almost half of the events were spontaneous .
Relatives with splice - site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations .
We conclude that persons with PROS1 gene defects and protein S deficiency are at increased risk of thrombosis and that free protein S estimation offers the most reliable way of diagnosing the deficiency .

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) in a child from consanguineous parents : a dominant or recessive disease ?
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) is characterized by autoimmune features and lymphoproliferations and is generally caused by defective Fas - mediated apoptosis .
This report describes a child with clinical features of ALPS without detectable Fas expression on freshly isolated blood leukocytes .
Detection of FAS transcripts via real - time quantitative PCR made a severe transcriptional defect unlikely .
Sequencing of the FAS gene revealed a 20 - nucleotide duplication in the last exon affecting the cytoplasmic signaling domain .
The patient was homozygous for this mutation , whereas the consanguineous parents and the siblings were heterozygous .
The patient reported here is a human homologue of the Fas - null mouse , inasmuch as she carries an autosomal homozygous mutation in the FAS gene and she shows the severe and accelerated ALPS phenotype .
The heterozygous family members did not have the ALPS phenotype , indicating that the disease - causing FAS mutation in this family is autosomal recessive . .
Identification of novel imprinted transcripts in the Prader - Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome deletion region : further evidence for regional imprinting control .
Deletions and other abnormalities of human chromosome 15q11 - q13 are associated with two developmental disorders , Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) .
Loss of expression of imprinted , paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS .
However , the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS , and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent - of - origin - specific manner , are unknown .
To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11 - q13 , we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS - AS deletion interval .
The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation - hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase - PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map .
Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1 .
5 - Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN - associated imprinting center , which already includes four imprinted , paternally expressed genes .
All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles .
A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process .
This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11 - q13 .
Combined analysis of hereditary prostate cancer linkage to 1q24 - 25 : results from 772 hereditary prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics .
A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer - susceptibility locus at 1q24 - 25 .
Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results .
In addition , evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27 - 28 , 1q42 - 43 , and 1p36 .
The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24 - 25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics ( ICPCG ) from North America , Australia , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the United Kingdom .
Overall , there was some evidence for linkage , with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity ( HLOD ) of 1 .
40 ( P = . 01 ) at D1S212 .
The estimated proportion of families ( alpha ) linked to the locus was .
06 ( 1 - LOD support interval . 01 - . 12 ) .
This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach , presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity .
Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male - to - male disease transmission within the families .
In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 .
In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 .
56 ( P = . 0006 ) and alpha = .
11 ( 1 - LOD support interval . 04 - . 19 ) , compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families .
Within the families with male - to - male disease transmission , alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis ( < 65 years , alpha = . 19 , with 1 - LOD support interval . 06 - . 34 ) and the number of affected family members ( five or more family members , alpha = . 15 , with 1 - LOD support interval . 04 - . 28 ) .
The highest value of alpha was observed for the 48 families that met all three criteria ( peak HLOD = 2 . 25 , P = . 001 , alpha = . 29 , with 1 - LOD support interval . 08 - . 53 ) .
These results support the finding of a prostate cancer - susceptibility gene linked to 1q24 - 25 , albeit in a defined subset of prostate cancer families .
Although HPC1 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary prostate cancer , it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male - to - male disease transmission .
A recurrent expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats causes Huntington disease in two sisters .
Large intergenerational repeat expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HD gene have been well documented for the male germline .
We describe a recurrent large expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats ( to 66 and 57 repeats , respectively , in two daughters ) associated with onset of Huntington disease ( HD ) in the second and third decade in a family without history of HD .
Our findings give evidence of a gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother .
We hypothesize that large expansions also occur in the female germline and that a negative selection of oocytes with long repeats might explain the different instability behavior of the male and the female germlines . .
Abnormal development of Purkinje cells and lymphocytes in Atm mutant mice .
Motor incoordination , immune deficiencies , and an increased risk of cancer are the characteristic features of the hereditary disease ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) , which is caused by mutations in the ATM gene .
Through gene targeting , we have generated a line of Atm mutant mice , Atm ( y / y ) mice .
In contrast to other Atm mutant mice , Atm ( y / y ) mice show a lower incidence of thymic lymphoma and survive beyond a few months of age .
Atm ( y / y ) mice exhibit deficits in motor learning indicative of cerebellar dysfunction .
Even though we found no gross cerebellar degeneration in older Atm ( y / y ) animals , ectopic and abnormally differentiated Purkinje cells were apparent in mutant mice of all ages .
These findings establish that some neuropathological abnormalities seen in A - T patients also are present in Atm mutant mice .
In addition , we report a previously unrecognized effect of Atm deficiency on development or maintenance of CD4 ( + ) 8 ( + ) thymocytes .
We discuss these findings in the context of the hypothesis that abnormal development of Purkinje cells and lymphocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of A - T . .
Novel mutations of the ATP7B gene in Japanese patients with Wilson disease .
Wilson disease ( WD ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver , brain , kidneys , and corneas , and culminating in copper toxication in these organs .
In this study , we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene , ATP7B , in four Japanese patients with WD .
By direct sequencing , we identified five mutations , of which two were novel , and 16 polymorphisms , of which 6 were novel .
The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected .
In contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic - type of early onset , the mutations A874V , R778L , and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or in frame 1 - amino acid deletion , and occurred in the patients with hepato - neurologic type of late onset .
The mutations 2871delC and R778L have been previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients .
In particular , R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries of the world .
Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population - specific manner .
Therefore , the accumulation of the types of mutations in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients . .
Autoinhibition and activation mechanisms of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein .
The Rho - family GTPase , Cdc42 , can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family members .
Activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the GTPase - binding domain and the carboxy - terminal region of WASP proteins .
Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase - binding domain of WASP , which can be induced by the C - terminal region or by organic co - solvents .
In the autoinhibited complex , intramolecular interactions with the GTPase - binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleating complex .
Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase - binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change , resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus , enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery .
These data show that intrinsically unstructured peptides such as the GTPase - binding domain of WASP can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context . .
hCds1 - mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 regulates the DNA damage response .
Mutations in the BRCA1 ( ref . 1 ) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer .
Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood , it is important for DNA damage repair and cell - cycle checkpoint .
BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage .
It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related .
In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication - block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family .
Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase ( hCds1 / Chk2 ) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1 .
We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co - localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation .
Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1 .
This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1 - mutated cell line HCC1937 . .
Characterization of the rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene .
Machado - Joseph disease ( MJD ) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia .
The disease - causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable and expanded ( CAG ) n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function .
In Caucasians , repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 ( SCA3 ) .
In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1 / SCA3 gene we cloned the rat homologue and studied its expression .
The rat and human ataxin - 3 genes are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88 % .
However , the C - terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the published human sequence .
The ( CAG ) n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential for the normal function of the ataxin - 3 protein in rodents .
The expression pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analyses .
The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length .
In rat testis , a smaller transcript of 1 .
3 kb was identified .
Transcription of rsca3 was detected in most rat tissues including brain .
Analyzing the expression level of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD .
Thus additional molecules and / or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain areas .
Emerin , deficiency of which causes Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy , is localized at the inner nuclear membrane .
X - linked recessive Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is an inherited muscle disorder characterized by the clinical triad of progressive wasting of humero - peroneal muscles , early contractures of the elbows , Achilles tendons and postcervical muscles , and cardiac conduction block with a high risk of sudden death .
The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non - muscle tissues .
To investigate a possible physiological role for emerin , we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells , using ultrathin cryosections .
We found that the immune - labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane , but not on the nuclear pore .
Emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina , even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins .
These results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch , and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina .
We speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability , as well as nuclear functions , particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction - relaxation movements and calcium flux . .
Locus heterogeneity in Friedreich ataxia .
Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia .
The disease locus was assigned to chromosome 9 and the disease gene , STM7 / X25 , has been isolated .
To date most data suggest locus homogeneity in FRDA .
We now provide strong evidence of a second FRDA locus .
Studying two siblings with FRDA from two families we did not detect a mutation in STM7 / X25 .
Haplotype analysis of the STM7 / X25 region of chromosome 9 demonstrated that the relevant portion of chromosome 9 differs in the patients .
Although the patients studied had typical FRDA , one sibpair had the uncommon symptom of retained tendon reflexes .
In order to investigate whether retained tendon reflexes are characteristic of FRDA caused by the second locus , FRDA2 , we studied an unrelated FRDA patient with retained tendon reflexes .
The observation of typical mutations in STM7 / X25 ( GAA expansions ) in this patient demonstrates that the two genetically different forms of FRDA cannot be distinguished clinically . .
Glycerol as a correlate of impaired glucose tolerance : dissection of a complex system by use of a simple genetic trait .
Glycerol kinase ( GK ) represents the primary entry of glycerol into glucose and triglyceride metabolism .
Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) and hypertriglyceridemia are associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease .
The relationship between glycerol and the risk of IGT , however , is poorly understood .
We therefore undertook the study of fasting plasma glycerol levels in a cohort of 1 , 056 unrelated men and women of French - Canadian descent .
Family screening in the initial cohort identified 18 men from five families with severe hyperglycerolemia ( values above 2 . 0 mmol / liter ) and demonstrated an X - linked pattern of inheritance .
Linkage analysis of the data from 12 microsatellite markers surrounding the Xp21 .
3 GK gene resulted in a peak LOD score of 3 .
46 , centered around marker DXS8039 .
In addition , since all of the families originated in a population with a proven founder effect - the Saguenay Lac - St .
- Jean region of Quebec - a common disease haplotype was sought .
Indeed , a six - marker haplotype extending over a region of 5 .
5 cM was observed in all families .
Resequencing of the GK gene in family members led to the discovery of a N288D missense mutation in exon 10 , which resulted in the substitution of a highly conserved asparagine residue by a negatively charged aspartic acid .
Clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias .
Primary dystonias are movement disorders with dystonia as a major symptom .
They are frequently inherited as Mendelian traits .
There are at least eight clinically distinct autosomal dominant and two X - linked recessive forms .
In addition , pedigree analyses suggest the occurrence of an autosomal recessive variant .
The clinical classification is increasingly being replaced by a genetic one .
To date gene loci have been identified in at least six autosomal dominant forms , i . e . , in idiopathic torsion dystonia ( 9q34 ) , focal dystonia ( 18p ) , adult - onset idiopathic torsion dystonia of mixed type ( 8p21 - q22 ) , dopa - responsive dystonia ( 14q22 . 1 - q22 . 2 ) , and paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis ( 2q25 - q33 ; 1p21 - p13 . 3 ) .
Gene loci in the X - linked recessive forms have been assigned to Xq13 .
1 in the X - linked dystonia parkinsonism syndrome and to Xq22 in X - linked sensorineural deafness , dystonia , and mental retardation .
The disease genes have been identified in two autosomal dominant forms and in one X - linked recessive form .
Mutations in a gene coding for an ATP - binding protein were detected in idiopathic torsion dystonia ( DYT1 ) , and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene is mutated in dopa - responsive dystonia ( DYT5 ) .
In sensorineural deafness , dystonia , and mental retardation , mutations were found in the gene DDP coding for a polypeptide of unknown function .
This article reviews the clinical and molecular genetics of primary dystonias , critically discusses present findings , and proposes referring to the known forms , most of which can be distinguished by genetic criteria , as dystonias 1 - 12 .
Determination of 30 X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy mutations , including 15 not previously described .
X - linked Adrenoleukodystrophy ( X - ALD ) is the most frequent peroxisomal disease .
It mainly involves the nervous system white matter , adrenal cortex and testes .
Several distinct clinical phenotypes are known .
The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very - long - chain fatty acids ( VLCFAs > C22 0 , mainly C26 0 ) , which is due to impaired capacity for beta - oxidation in peroxisomes .
Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers .
In 0 .
1 % of affected males , however , the plasma C26 0 level is borderline normal , and 15 % of obligate female carriers have normal results .
Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk .
Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X - ALD mutations , because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status .
We describe a fast method for detection of X - ALD mutations .
The method is based on SSCP analysis of nested PCR fragments followed by sequence - determination reactions .
Using this methodology we have found X - ALD mutations in 30 kindreds , including 15 not previously reported .
beta - galactosidase gene mutations affecting the lysosomal enzyme and the elastin - binding protein in GM1 - gangliosidosis patients with cardiac involvement .
GM1 - gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid beta - galactosidase ( GLB1 ) .
We report five new beta - galactosidase gene mutations in nine Italian patients and one fetus , segregating in seven unrelated families .
Six of the eight patients with the infantile , severe form of the disease presented cardiac involvement , a feature rarely associated with GM1 - gangliosidosis .
Molecular analysis of the patients RNA and DNA identified two new RNA splicing defects , three new and three previously described amino acid substitutions .
Interestingly , all patients with cardiac involvement were homozygous for one of these mutations R59H , Y591C , Y591N , or IVS14 - 2A > G .
In contrast , all other patients were compound heterozygous for one of the following mutations R201H , R482H , G579D , IVS8 + 2T > C .
Although we could not directly correlate the presence of cardiac abnormalities with specific genetic lesions , the mutations identified in patients with cardiomyopathy fell in the GLB1 cDNA region common to the lysosomal enzyme and the Hbeta - Gal - related protein , also known as the elastin binding protein ( EBP ) .
Consequently , both molecules are affected by the mutations , and they may contribute differently to the occurrence of specific clinical manifestations . .
In vivo modulation of Hmgic reduces obesity .
The HMGI family of proteins consists of three members , HMGIC , HMGI and HMGI ( Y ) , that function as architectural factors and are essential components of the enhancesome .
HMGIC is predominantly expressed in proliferating , undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and is not detected in adult tissues .
It is disrupted and misexpressed in a number of mesenchymal tumour cell types , including fat - cell tumours ( lipomas ) .
In addition Hmgic - / - mice have a deficiency in fat tissue .
To study its role in adipogenesis and obesity , we examined Hmgic expression in the adipose tissue of adult , obese mice .
Mice with a partial or complete deficiency of Hmgic resisted diet - induced obesity .
Disruption of Hmgic caused a reduction in the obesity induced by leptin deficiency ( Lepob / Lepob ) in a gene - dose - dependent manner .
Our studies implicate a role for HMGIC in fat - cell proliferation , indicating that it may be an adipose - specific target for the treatment of obesity . .
Molecular analysis of the genotype - phenotype relationship in factor X deficiency .
Factor X deficiency is a rare haemorrhagic condition , normally inherited as an autosomal recessive trait , in which a variable clinical presentation correlates poorly with laboratory phenotype .
The factor X ( F10 ) genes of 14 unrelated individuals with factor X deficiency ( 12 familial and two sporadic cases ) were sequenced yielding a total of 13 novel mutations .
Family studies were performed in order to distinguish the contributions of individual mutant F10 alleles to the clinical and laboratory phenotypes .
Missense mutations were studied by means of molecular modelling , whereas single basepair substitutions in splice sites and the 5 flanking region were examined by in vitro splicing assay and luciferase reporter gene assay respectively .
The deletion allele of a novel hexanucleotide insertion / deletion polymorphism in the F10 gene promoter region was shown by reporter gene assay , to reduce promoter activity by approximately 20 % .
One family manifesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance possessed three clinically affected members who were heterozygous for a splice - site mutation that was predicted to lead to the production of a truncated protein product .
A model which accounts for the dominant negative effect of this lesion is presented .
Variation in the antigen level of heterozygous relatives of probands was found to be significantly higher between families than within families , consistent with the view that the nature of the F10 lesion ( s ) segregating in a given family is a prime determinant of the laboratory phenotype .
By contrast , no such relationship could be discerned between laboratory phenotype and polymorphism genotype . .
Transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of the high mobility group I - C protein develop adiposity and an abnormally high prevalence of lipomas .
Chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group ( HMG ) I - C DNA - binding domains and C - terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors , suggesting a potential role for HMG I - C in the development of lipomas .
To evaluate the role of the HMG I - C component , the three DNA - binding domains of HMG I - C have now been expressed in transgenic mice .
Despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I - C protein , the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life , show marked adipose tissue inflammation , and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas .
These findings demonstrate that the DNA - binding domains of HMG I - C , in the absence of a C - terminal fusion partner , are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas .
We provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors . .
ATM phosphorylates p95 / nbs1 in an S - phase checkpoint pathway .
The rare diseases ataxia - telangiectasia ( AT ) , caused by mutations in the ATM gene , and Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) , with mutations in the p95 / nbs1 gene , share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability , radiation sensitivity and defects in cell - cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation .
The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs , whereas p95 / nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double - strand breaks .
Here , because of the similarities between AT and NBS , we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95 / nbs1 .
Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM - dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95 / nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation .
However , p95 / nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM - dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation .
A p95 / nbs1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an S - phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells .
These observations link ATM and p95 / nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two diseases . .
Understanding the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome .
Fragile X syndrome , a common form of inherited mental retardation , is mainly caused by massive expansion of CGG triplet repeats located in the 5 - untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation - 1 ( FMR1 ) gene .
In patients with fragile X syndrome , the expanded CGG triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the FMR1 gene is repressed , which leads to the absence of FMR1 protein ( FMRP ) and subsequent mental retardation .
FMRP is an RNA - binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm .
This protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
We discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of CGG repeat expansion and physiological function ( s ) of FMRP .
These studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence . .
Haploinsufficiency of the transcription factors FOXC1 and FOXC2 results in aberrant ocular development .
Anterior segment developmental disorders , including Axenfeld - Rieger anomaly ( ARA ) , variably associate with harmfully elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , which causes glaucoma .
Clinically observed dysgenesis does not correlate with IOP , however , and the etiology of glaucoma development is not understood .
The forkhead transcription factor genes Foxc1 ( formerly Mf1 ) and Foxc2 ( formerly Mfh1 ) are expressed in the mesenchyme from which the ocular drainage structures derive .
Mutations in the human homolog of Foxc1 , FKHL7 , cause dominant anterior segment defects and glaucoma in various families .
We show that Foxc1 ( + / - ) mice have anterior segment abnormalities similar to those reported in human patients .
These abnormalities include small or absent Schlemms canal , aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork , iris hypoplasia , severely eccentric pupils and displaced Schwalbes line .
The penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background .
In some affected eyes , collagen bundles were half normal diameter , or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse .
Thus , abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes .
Despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in Foxc1 ( + / - ) mice , IOP was normal in almost all mice analyzed , on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages .
Similar abnormalities were found in Foxc2 ( + / - ) mice , but no disease - associated mutations were identified in the human homolog FKHL14 in 32 ARA patients .
Foxc1 ( + / - ) and Foxc2 ( + / - ) mice are useful models for studying anterior segment development and its anomalies , and may allow identification of genes that interact with Foxc1 and Foxc2 ( or FKHL7 and FKHL14 ) to produce a phenotype with elevated IOP and glaucoma . .
( Over ) correction of FMR1 deficiency with YAC transgenics : behavioral and physical features .
Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of mental retardation involving loss of expression of the FMR1 gene .
The role of FMR1 remains undetermined but the protein appears to be involved in RNA metabolism .
Fmr1 knockout mice exhibit a phenotype with some similarities to humans , such as macroorchidism and behavioral abnormalities .
As a step toward understanding the function of FMR1 and the determination of the potential for therapeutic approaches to fragile X syndrome , yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) transgenic mice were generated in order to determine whether the Fmr1 knockout mouse phenotype could be rescued .
Several transgenic lines were generated that carried the entire FMR1 locus with extensive amounts of flanking sequence .
We observed that the YAC transgene supported production of the human protein ( FMRP ) which was present at levels 10 to 15 times that of endogenous protein and was expressed in a cell - and tissue - specific manner .
Macro - orchidism was absent in knockout mice carrying the YAC transgene indicating functional rescue by the human protein .
Given the complex behavioral phenotype in fragile X patients and the mild phenotype previously reported for the Fmr1 knockout mouse , we performed a more thorough evaluation of the Fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays that had not previously been reported for this animal model .
The mouse displayed reduced anxiety - related responses with increased exploratory behavior .
FMR1 YAC transgenic mice overexpressing the human protein did produce opposing behavioral responses and additional abnormal behaviors were also observed .
These findings have significant implications for gene therapy for fragile X syndrome since overexpression of the gene may harbor its own phenotype . .
Transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded CTG repeat mimic closely the DM CTG repeat intergenerational and somatic instability .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3UTR of the DM protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene .
A very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset .
Furthermore , tissues from DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age .
We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20 , 55 or > 300 CTG , cloned from patients from the same affected DM family .
Using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification , we demonstrate that the intergenerational CTG repeat instability is reproduced in mice , with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex - and size - dependent characteristics as in humans .
Moreover , a high level of instability , increasing with age , can be observed in tissues and in sperm .
Although we did not observe dramatic expansions ( or big jumps over several hundred CTG repeats ) as in congenital forms of DM , our model carrying > 300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the human DM situation .
Our three models carrying different sizes of CTG repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the CTG repeat instability . .
Inactivation of the Friedreich ataxia mouse gene leads to early embryonic lethality without iron accumulation .
Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , the most common autosomal recessive ataxia , is caused in almost all cases by homozygous intronic expansions resulting in the loss of frataxin , a mitochondrial protein conserved through evolution , and involved in mitochondrial iron homeostasis .
Yeast knockout models , and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin defect causes a specific iron - sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes .
Affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis .
To study the mechanism of the disease , we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the Frda gene product .
We show that homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality a few days after implantation , demonstrating an important role for frataxin during early development .
These results suggest that the milder phenotype in humans is due to residual frataxin expression associated with the expansion mutations .
Surprisingly , in the frataxin knockout mouse , no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic resorption , suggesting that cell death could be due to a mechanism independent of iron accumulation . .
Gaucher disease : the origins of the Ashkenazi Jewish N370S and 84GG acid beta - glucosidase mutations .
Type 1 Gaucher disease ( GD ) , a non - neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder , results from the deficient activity of acid beta - glucosidase ( GBA ) .
Type 1 disease is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ( AJ ) descent .
Of the causative GBA mutations , N370S is particularly frequent in the AJ population , ( q approximately . 03 ) , whereas the 84GG insertion ( q approximately . 003 ) occurs exclusively in the Ashkenazim .
To investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the AJ population , short tandem repeat ( STR ) markers were used to map a 9 .
3 - cM region containing the GBA locus and to genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes , 60 European non - Jewish N370S chromosomes , and 62 AJ 84GG chromosomes .
A highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking GBA ( PKLR , D1S1595 , D1S2721 , and D1S2777 ) was observed on both the AJ chromosomes and the non - Jewish N370S chromosomes , suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations .
Of note , the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo , recurrent N370S mutations .
In contrast , a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84GG chromosomes , which was unique to the AJ population .
On the basis of the linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) delta values , the non - Jewish European N370S chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less LD at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the AJ N370S chromosomes .
This finding is consistent with the presence of the N370S mutation in the non - Jewish European population prior to the founding of the AJ population .
Coalescence analyses for the N370S and 84GG mutations estimated similar coalescence times , of 48 and 55 . 5 generations ago , respectively .
The results of these studies are consistent with a significant bottleneck occurring in the AJ population during the first millennium , when the population became established in Europe .
HLA B27 and the genetics of ankylosing spondylitis .
One hundred and twenty - eight of 145 patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) were found to be HLA B27 positive .
Five patients had evidence of a sero - negative peripheral arthritis resembling peripheral psoriatic arthritis and 3 of these were B27 negative .
One further B27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis and a mother with ulcerative colitis .
There was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in B27 negative patients .
These findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing spondylitis with genes for psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease being important in some individuals , particularly those who are B27 negative .
Twenty - five first - degree relatives with ankylosing spondylitis were all B27 positive .
The only instance of disassociation of B27 and spondylitis in a family was where the proband had ulcerative colitis as well as spondylitis .
Of 13 B27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing spondylitis ( 23 % ) .
These findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing spondylitis is not B27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one - fifth of B27 positive males to result in disease . .
Founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene in Polish families with breast - ovarian cancer .
We have undertaken a hospital - based study , to identify possible BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Polish population .
The study group consisted of 66 Polish families with cancer who have at least three related females affected with breast or ovarian cancer and who had cancer diagnosed , in at least one of the three affected females , at age < 50 years .
A total of 26 families had both breast and ovarian cancers , 4 families had ovarian cancers only , and 36 families had breast cancers only .
Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family .
The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations , by use of SSCP followed by direct sequencing of observed variants .
Mutations were found in 35 ( 53 % ) of the 66 families studied .
All but one of the mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene .
BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only , in 67 % of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer , and in 34 % of 35 families with breast cancer only .
The single family with a BRCA2 mutation had the breast - ovarian cancer syndrome .
Seven distinct mutations were identified ; five of these occurred in two or more families .
In total , recurrent mutations were found in 33 ( 94 % ) of the 35 families with detected mutations .
Three BRCA1 abnormalities - 5382insC , C61G , and 4153delA - accounted for 51 % , 20 % , and 11 % of the identified mutations , respectively . .
Molecular basis of very long chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in three Israeli patients : identification of a complex mutant allele with P65L and K247Q mutations , the former being an exonic mutation causing exon 3 skipping .
Very long chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency is a life - threatening disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta - oxidation .
We identified four novel mutations in three unrelated patients .
All patients had the severe childhood form of VLCAD deficiency with early onset and high mortality .
Immunoblot analysis revealed that VLCAD protein was undetectable in patients 2 and 3 , whereas normal - size VLCAD protein and an aberrant form of VLCAD ( 4kDa smaller ) were detected in patient 1 .
As expected , null mutations were found in patients 2 and 3 patient 2 is homozygous for a frameshift mutation , del 4 bp at 798 - 801 , and patient 3 is homozygous for a nonsense mutation 65C > A ( S22X ) .
Patient 1 was homozygous for a complex mutant allele containing two alterations , including a 194C > T transition ( P65L ) and 739A > C transversion ( K247Q ) ; in the case of P65L , the amino acid change does not reduce enzyme activity .
However , the nucleotide change resulted in exon 3 skipping , whereas the latter K247Q mutation had a drastic effect on enzyme activity .
We verified these events by in vivo splicing experiments and transient expression analysis of mutant cDNAs .
The P65L mutation locates 11 bases upstream of a splice donor site of intron 3 .
This is an example of an exonic mutation which affects exon - splicing . .
Submicroscopic deletion in cousins with Prader - Willi syndrome causes a grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern : effects of imprinting .
The Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) critical region on 15q11 - q13 is subject to imprinting .
PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed .
Familial PWS is rare .
We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN , but not the closely associated loci D15S10 , D15S11 , D15S63 , and GABRB3 .
The cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal .
The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study , and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN .
DNA methylation analysis of D15S63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with PWS .
" Grandmatrilineal " inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted , paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons .
In this case , PWS does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line .
This represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting . .
Human glycine decarboxylase gene ( GLDC ) and its highly conserved processed pseudogene ( psiGLDC ) : their structure and expression , and the identification of a large deletion in a family with nonketotic hyperglycinemia .
Mutations in the glycine decarboxylase gene ( GLDC ) cause nonketotic hyperglycinemia ( NKH ) , an in - born error of metabolism characterized by severe neurological disturbance .
We have determined the structure of GLDC and of its pseudogene ( psiGLDC ) and studied their expression for a molecular analysis of NKH .
The GLDC gene spans at least 135 kb and consists of 25 exons .
All donor and acceptor sites adhere to the canonical GT - AG rule , except for the donor site of intron 21 , where a variant form GC is used instead of GT .
The transcription initiation site has been assigned to a residue 163 bp upstream from the translation initiation triplet by primer extension analysis .
The psiGLDC gene has no intron and shares 97 .
5 % homology with the coding region of functional GLDC , suggesting that psiGLDC is a processed pseudogene that arose from the GLDC transcript about 4 - 8 million years ago .
RNA blotting analysis has revealed that GLDC is expressed in human liver , kidney , brain , and placenta .
We have also examined a patient with NKH with no detectable GLDC mRNA in his lymphoblasts .
Exons 1 - 3 of the functional GLDC gene from this patient are not amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , whereas those from control subjects are .
These results suggest a large homozygous deletion ( at least 30 kb ) in the patient .
Furthermore , we have devised a semi - quantitative PCR to estimate the number of GLDC alleles by using psiGLDC as an internal control and have confirmed the homozygosity and heterozygosity of the deletion in the patient and his parents , respectively .
Structural information of GLDC and psiGLDC should facilitate the molecular analysis of NKH .
De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia , gonadal hypoplasia , obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia , leading to profound obesity .
PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11 - q13 ( ref . 2 ) .
Five imprinted , paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region , MKRN3 ( ref . 3 ) , NDN ( ref . 4 ) , NDNL1 ( ref . 5 ) , SNRPN ( refs 6 - 8 ) and IPW ( ref . 9 ) , as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR - 1 and PAR - 5 ( ref . 10 ) .
Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre ( IC ) , which overlaps SNRPN ( refs 10 , 11 ) .
Deletion of the SNRPN promoter / exon 1 region ( the PWS IC element ) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS .
Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome .
The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells .
We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion .
Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint , but also for its postzygotic maintenance . .
Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts : implications for myotonic dystrophy .
Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy , a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia , cataracts and cardiac conduction defects .
Targeted deletion of Dm15 , the mouse orthologue of human DMPK , produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities , but without other features of myotonic dystrophy , such as myotonia and cataracts .
We , and others , have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 ( refs 7 , 8 ) , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor .
To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype , we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta - galactosidase reporter .
Six5 - mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues , including the developing lens .
Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function , but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls .
Our results suggest that SIX5 deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy , and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder . .
Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting , myotonia , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperinsulinaemia , mental retardation and ocular cataracts .
The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain - encoding gene , SIX5 ( formerly DMAHP ; refs 2 - 5 ) .
There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM .
First , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels .
Second , CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription .
Third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA ( refs 10 , 11 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose - dependent loss of Dm15 ( the mouse DMPK homologue ) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders .
To test the role of Six5 loss in DM , we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted .
Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive .
Six5 + / - and Six5 - / - mice show increased steady - state levels of the Na + / K + - ATPase alpha - 1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels .
Thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation .
As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM , these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM .
Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5 . .
ATM - dependent phosphorylation of nibrin in response to radiation exposure .
Mutations in the gene ATM are responsible for the genetic disorder ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) , which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction , radiosensitivity , chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition .
Both the A - T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA - damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition , signalling and repair of DNA double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) .
There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity , chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A - T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) .
The protein defective in NBS , nibrin ( encoded by NBS1 ) , forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 ( refs 1 , 2 ) .
This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation ( IR ) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time .
The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A - T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway .
Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR .
This response is abrogated in A - T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full - length mutant protein .
We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro .
Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin ( S343A ) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells .
ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin - MRE11 - RAD50 association as revealed by radiation - induced foci formation .
Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A - T and NBS . .
Clinicopathologic features of BRCA - linked and sporadic ovarian cancer .
CONTEXT Most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 .
Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results , especially regarding survival .
OBJECTIVE To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic ( nonhereditary ) ovarian cancers .
DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution , which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute , over a 12 - year period ( December 1986 to August 1998 ) .
PATIENTS The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group .
From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish , 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 .
The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups ( Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111 ) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials ( for the survival analysis ) were included for comparison .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age at diagnosis , surgical stage , histologic cell type and grade , and surgical outcome ; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced - stage ( II and IV ) cases .
RESULTS Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years , with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1 - vs BRCA2 - linked patients ( 54 vs 62 years ; P = . 04 ) .
Histology , grade , stage , and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases .
The hereditary group had a longer disease - free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group , with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months , respectively ( P < . 001 ) .
Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group ( P = . 004 ) .
For stage III cancers , BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable ( P = . 03 ) .
CONCLUSIONS Although BRCA - associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers , advanced - stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients .
Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1 - linked than for BRCA2 - linked cancers in this population .
The gene for familial Mediterranean fever , MEFV , is expressed in early leukocyte development and is regulated in response to inflammatory mediators .
Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever and neutrophil - mediated serosal inflammation .
We recently identified the gene causing FMF , designated MEFV , and found it to be expressed in mature neutrophils , suggesting that it functions as an inflammatory regulator .
To facilitate our understanding of the normal function of MEFV , we extended our previous studies .
MEFV messenger RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow leukocytes , with differential expression observed among cells by in situ hybridization .
CD34 hematopoietic stem - cell cultures induced toward the granulocytic lineage expressed MEFV at the myelocyte stage , concurrently with lineage commitment .
The prepromyelocytic cell line HL60 expressed MEFV only at granulocytic and monocytic differentiation .
MEFV was also expressed in the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP - 1 .
Among peripheral blood leukocytes , MEFV expression was detected in neutrophils , eosinophils , and to varying degrees , monocytes .
Consistent with the tissue specificity of expression , complete sequencing and analysis of upstream regulatory regions of MEFV revealed homology to myeloid - specific promoters and to more broadly expressed inflammatory promoter elements .
In vitro stimulation of monocytes with the proinflammatory agents interferon ( IFN ) gamma , tumor necrosis factor , and lipopolysaccharide induced MEFV expression , whereas the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin ( IL ) 4 , IL - 10 , and transforming growth factor beta inhibited such expression .
Induction by IFN - gamma occurred rapidly and was resistant to cycloheximide .
IFN - alpha also induced MEFV expression .
In granulocytes , MEFV was up - regulated by IFN - gamma and the combination of IFN - alpha and colchicine .
These results refine understanding of MEFV by placing the gene in the myelomonocytic - specific proinflammatory pathway and identifying it as an IFN - gamma immediate early gene . .
Biochemical and structural analysis of missense mutations in N - acetylgalactosamine - 6 - sulfate sulfatase causing mucopolysaccharidosis IVA phenotypes .
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ; OMIM # 253000 ) , a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N - acetylgalactosamine - 6 - sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ) , has variable clinical phenotypes .
To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients , but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear .
We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations , using structural analyses .
Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations ( C79S , C79T ) were characterized by transient expression analysis .
Mutant proteins , except for C79S and C79T , were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size .
Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity .
Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity ( 1 . 3 - 13 . 3 % of wild - type GALNS activity ) .
Sulfatases , including GALNS , are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology .
Thus , a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X - ray crystal structure of N - acetylgalacto - samine - 4 - sulfatase and arylsulfatase A , using homology modeling , and 32 missense mutations were investigated .
Consequently , we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype ( i ) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing ; ( ii ) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation ; ( iii ) modification of the active site .
In contrast , mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein .
These studies shed further light on the genotype - phenotype correlation of MPS IVA and structure - function relationship in the sulfatase family .
Mutations at the ataxia - telangiectasia locus and clinical phenotypes of A - T patients .
Mutations at the ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) locus on chromosome band 11q22 cause a distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome in homozygotes and predispose heterozygotes to cancer , ischemic heart disease , and early mortality .
PCR amplification from genomic DNA and automated sequencing of the entire coding region ( 66 exons ) and splice junctions detected 77 mutations ( 85 % ) in 90 A - T chromosomes .
Heteroduplex analysis detected another 42 mutations at the A - T locus .
Out of a total of 71 unique mutations , 50 were found only in a single family , and 51 had not been reported previously .
Most ( 58 / 71 , 82 % ) mutations were frameshift and nonsense mutations that are predicted to cause truncation of the A - T protein ; the less common mutation types were missense ( 9 / 71 , 13 % ) , splicing ( 3 / 71 , 4 % ) and one in - frame deletion , 2546 3 ( 1 / 71 , 1 % ) .
The mean survival and height distribution of 134 A - T patients correlated significantly with the specific mutations present in the patients .
Patients homozygous for a single truncating mutation , typically near the N - terminal end of the gene , or heterozygous for the in - frame deletion 2546 3 , were shorter and had significantly shorter survival than those heterozygous for a splice site or missense mutation , or heterozygous for two truncating mutations .
Alterations of the length or amino acid composition of the A - T gene product affect the A - T clinical phenotype in different ways .
Mutation analysis at the A - T locus may help estimate the prognosis of A - T patients . .
Isolation , genomic organization , and expression analysis of the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV , the gene for familial mediterranean fever .
Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis .
Recently the FMF gene ( MEFV ) was cloned ; the protein product , pyrin / marenostrin , is thought to regulate inflammation in myeloid cells .
In this manuscript we report the mouse and rat homologs of MEFV .
The murine gene contains ten exons with a coding sequence of 2304 bp , while the rat homolog has nine exons with a coding sequence of 2253 bp .
A considerable amino acid sequence homology was observed between the mouse and human ( 47 . 6 % identity and 65 . 5 % similarity ) and between the mouse and rat genes ( 73 . 5 % identity and 82 . 1 % similarity ) .
The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin , including a B - box zinc finger domain , Robbins - Dingwall nuclear localization signal , and coiled - coil domain .
However , perhaps because of an ancient frame - shift mutation , neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact C - terminal B30 .
2 domain , in which most FMF - associated mutations have been found in human MEFV .
Nevertheless , like the human gene , mouse Mefv is expressed in peripheral blood granulocytes but not lymphocytes .
Consistent with its expression in granulocytes , Mefv was detected at high levels in the primary follicles and marginal zones of the splenic white pulp .
Mefv is localized on mouse Chromosome ( Chr ) 16 , region A3 - B1 , extending a region of synteny with human Chr 16p13 .

Development of knockout and knockin mouse models may provide further insights into the functional evolution of this gene .
Additional copies of the proteolipid protein gene causing Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease arise by separate integration into the X chromosome .
The proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) is normally present at chromosome Xq22 .
Mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) .
Here we describe two new families in which males affected with PMD were found to have a copy of PLP on the short arm of the X chromosome , in addition to a normal copy on Xq22 .
In the first family , the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the AhaII dimorphism within the PLP gene .
The results of FISH analysis showed an additional copy of PLP in Xp22 .
1 , although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis .
Another three affected males from the family had similar findings .
In a second unrelated family with signs of PMD , cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome .
In the inv ( X ) carried by several affected family members , FISH showed PLP signals at Xp11 .
4 and Xq22 .
A third family has previously been reported , in which affected members had an extra copy of the PLP gene detected at Xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern .
The identification of three separate families in which PLP is duplicated at a noncontiguous site suggests that such duplications could be a relatively common but previously undetected cause of genetic disorders .
The exon 13 duplication in the BRCA1 gene is a founder mutation present in geographically diverse populations .
The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group .
Recently , a 6 - kb duplication of exon 13 , which creates a frameshift in the coding sequence of the BRCA1 gene , has been described in three unrelated U .
S S . families of European ancestry and in one Portuguese family .
Here , our goal was to estimate the frequency and geographic diversity of carriers of this duplication .
To do this , a collaborative screening study was set up that involved 39 institutions from 19 countries and included 3 , 580 unrelated individuals with a family history of the disease and 934 early - onset breast and / or ovarian cancer cases .
A total of 11 additional families carrying this mutation were identified in Australia ( 1 ) , Belgium ( 1 ) , Canada ( 1 ) , Great Britain ( 6 ) , and the United States ( 2 ) .
Haplotyping showed that they are likely to derive from a common ancestor , possibly of northern British origin .
Our results demonstrate that it is strongly advisable , for laboratories carrying out screening either in English - speaking countries or in countries with historical links with Britain , to include within their BRCA1 screening protocols the polymerase chain reaction - based assay described in this report .
Genotype - phenotype correlations in families with deletions in the von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) gene .
Von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by predisposition for bilateral and multi - centric hemangioblastoma in the retina and central nervous system , pheochromocytoma , renal cell carcinoma , and cysts in the kidney , pancreas , and epididymis .
We describe five families for which direct sequencing of the coding region of the VHL gene had failed to identify the family - specific mutation .
Further molecular analysis revealed deletions involving the VHL gene in each of these families .
In four families , partial deletions of one or more exons were detected by Southern blot analysis .
In the fifth family , FISH analysis demonstrated the deletion of the entire VHL gene .
Our results show that ( quantitative ) Southern blot analysis is a sensitive method for detecting germline deletions of the VHL gene and should be implemented in routine DNA diagnosis for VHL disease .
Our data support the previously established observation that families with a germline deletion have a low risk for pheochromocytoma .
Further unraveling of genotype - phenotype correlations in VHL disease has revealed that families with a full or partial deletion of the VHL gene exhibit a phenotype with a preponderance of central nervous system hemangioblastoma . .
Age of the intronic GAA triplet repeat expansion mutation in Friedreich ataxia .
Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , the most frequently inherited ataxia , is due in the vast majority of cases to a large expansion of an intronic GAA repeat .
Using linkage disequilibrium analysis based on haplotype data of seven polymorphic markers close to the frataxin gene , the age of FRDA founding mutational event ( s ) is estimated to be at least 682 + / - 203 generations ( 95 % confidence interval 564 - 801 g ) , a dating which is consistent with little or no negative selection and provides further evidence for an ancient spread of a pre - mutation ( at - risk alleles ) in western Europe . .
Functional link between ataxia - telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products .
Ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes .
The protein product of the gene responsible for A - T , designated ATM , is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy - terminal phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - like domain .
The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1 .
Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1 , induced by ionizing radiation , requires catalytically active ATM .
Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation .
We have identified two residues of NBS1 , Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage .
This response includes S - phase checkpoint activation , formation of the NBS1 / Mrel1 / Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation .
Together , these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell - cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes . .
Homozygosity mapping in a family with microcephaly , mental retardation , and short stature to a Cohen syndrome region on 8q21 . 3 - 8q22 . 1 : redefining a clinical entity .
A syndrome of microcephaly , progressive postnatal growth deficiency , and mental retardation was observed in two brothers and their cousin from a multiply consanguineous kindred of Lebanese descent .
Hypotonia , chorioretinal dystrophy , and myopia were also identified .
The severity of the condition varied among the closely related patients .
Because of absence of a distinctive facial appearance , the degree of mental retardation , and short stature , the initially considered clinical diagnosis of Cohen syndrome was withdrawn and a novel genetic entity was assumed .
Homozygosity mapping in this family assigned the gene to a 26 .
8 - cM region on the chromosome band 8q21 .
3 - 22 .
1 , between the microsatellites at D8S270 and D8S514 .
The maximum two - point LOD score was found for marker at D8S267 ( Zmax = 3 . . 237 at Omax = 0 . 00 ) .
Intriguingly enough , the identified gene region overlaps the refined gene region for Cohen syndrome ( COH1 ) [ Kolehmainen et al . , 1997 Euro J Hum Genet 5 206 - 213 ] .
This fact encourages the hypothesis that the described kindred segregates for a variant of Cohen syndrome and suggests a redefinition of its phenotype
Polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene increase susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis .
Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) is a common and highly familial rheumatic disorder .
The sibling recurrence risk ratio for the disease is 63 and heritability assessed in twins > 90 % .
Although MHC genes , including HLA - B27 , contribute only 20 - 50 % of the genetic risk for the disease , no non - MHC gene has yet been convincingly demonstrated to influence either susceptibility to the disease or its phenotypic expression .
Previous linkage and association studies have suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for AS close to , or within , the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene ( CYP2D6 , debrisoquine hydroxylase ) located at chromosome 22q13 . 1 .
We performed a linkage study of chromosome 22 in 200 families with AS affected sibling - pairs .
Association of alleles of the CYP2D6 gene was examined by both case - control and within - family means .
For case - control studies , 617 unrelated individuals with AS ( 361 probands from sibling - pair and parent - case trio families and 256 unrelated non - familial sporadic cases ) and 402 healthy ethnically matched controls were employed .
For within - family association studies , 361 families including 161 parent - case trios and 200 affected sibling - pair families were employed .
Homozygosity for poor metabolizer alleles was found to be associated with AS .
Heterozygosity for the most frequent poor metabolizer allele ( CYP2D6 * 4 ) was not associated with increased susceptibility to AS .
Significant within - family association of CYP2D6 * 4 alleles and AS was demonstrated .
Weak linkage was also demonstrated between CYP2D6 and AS .
We postulate that altered metabolism of a natural toxin or antigen by the CYP2D6 gene may increase susceptibility to AS .
Functional differences of the PDS gene product are associated with phenotypic variation in patients with Pendred syndrome and non - syndromic hearing loss ( DFNB4 ) .
The PDS gene encodes a transmembrane protein , known as pendrin , which functions as a transporter of iodide and chloride .
Mutations in this gene are responsible for Pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non - syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB4 locus on chromosome 7q31 .
A screen of 20 individuals from the midwestern USA with non - syndromic hearing loss and dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people ( 15 % ) with PDS mutations .
To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non - syndromic hearing loss , we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants ( L236P , T416P and E384G ) , with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non - syndromic hearing loss ( V480D , V653A and I490L / G497S ) .
The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin - induced chloride and iodide transport , while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride , albeit at a much lower level than wild - type pendrin .
We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4 .
We propose a model for pendrin function in the thyroid in which pendrin transports iodide across the apical membrane of the thyrocyte into the colloid space . .
The human factor IX gene as germline mutagen test : samples from Mainland China have the putatively endogenous pattern of mutation .
Germline mutations are the major source of genetic variation that allows a species to evolve over time but at the cost of Mendelian disease and genetic predisposition to multifactorial diseases .
Previous analyses have revealed that the pattern of germline mutations in the factor IX gene ( F9 ) is similar among a variety of ethnically and geographically diverse populations and compatible with the ancient pattern that has shaped the mammalian genome .
Here , we compare the pattern of germline mutation in a population of hemophilia B patients from Mainland China ( n = 66 ) to that in U .
S .
Caucasians , Blacks , and Mexican Hispanics and stratify by disease severity and ethnicity .
The similar pattern of germline mutation in all ethnic groups studied to date provides additional data compatible with the inference that endogenous processes predominate in germline mutations .
Fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations .
Heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor Fas dominantly interfere with Fas - induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome .
This effect , rather than depending on ligand - induced receptor oligomerization , was found to stem from ligand - independent interaction of wild - type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain .
Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein .
These results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for Fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease . .
Determination of carrier status for the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome by flow cytometric analysis of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is caused by defects in the WAS protein ( WASP ) gene on the X chromosome .
Previous study disclosed that flow cytometric analysis of intracellular WASP expression ( FCM - WASP analysis ) in lymphocytes was useful for the diagnosis of WAS patients .
Lymphocytes from all WAS patients showed WASPdim instead of WASPbright .
Here we report that FCM - WASP analysis in monocytes could be a useful tool for the WAS carrier diagnosis .
Monocytes from all nine WAS carriers showed varied population of WASPdim together with WASPbright .
None of control individuals possessed the WASPdim population .
In contrast , lymphocytes from all the carriers except two lacked the WASPdim population .
The difference of the WASPdim population in monocytes and lymphocytes observed in WAS carriers suggests that WASP plays a more critical role in the development of lymphocytes than in that of monocytes .
The present studies suggest that a skewed X - chromosomal inactivation pattern observed in WAS carrier peripheral blood cells is not fixed at the hemopoietic stem cell level but progresses after the lineage commitment . .
Restoration of photoreceptor ultrastructure and function in retinal degeneration slow mice by gene therapy .
The gene Prph2 encodes a photoreceptor - specific membrane glycoprotein , peripherin - 2 ( also known as peripherin / rds ) , which is inserted into the rims of photoreceptor outer segment discs in a complex with rom - 1 ( ref . 2 ) .
The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs , which are renewed constantly throughout life , and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture .
Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies , including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy .
A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function , also seen in the retinal degeneration slow ( rds or Prph2 Rd2 / Rd2 ) mouse , which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2 .
It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments , downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells .
The electroretinograms ( ERGs ) of Prph2Rd2 / Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a - wave and b - wave amplitudes , which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months .
Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin - 2 and rhodopsin , which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments .
Moreover , the re - establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction .
These studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer . .
Mutations in the fibrinogen aalpha gene account for the majority of cases of congenital afibrinogenemia .
Congenital afibrinogenemia is a rare , autosomal , recessive disorder characterized by the complete absence of detectable fibrinogen .
We previously identified the first causative mutations in a nonconsanguineous Swiss family ; the 4 affected persons have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha ( FGA ) gene .
Haplotype data implied that these deletions occurred on distinct ancestral chromosomes , suggesting that this region may be susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism .
We subsequently showed that all the deletions were identical to the base pair and probably resulted from a nonhomologous recombination mediated by 7 - bp direct repeats .
In this study , we have collected data on 13 additional unrelated patients to identify the causative mutations and to determine the prevalence of the 11 - kb deletion .
A common recurrent mutation , at the donor splice site of FGA intron 4 ( IVS4 + 1 G > T ) , accounted for 14 of the 26 ( 54 % ) alleles .
One patient was heterozygous for the previously identified deletion .
Three more frameshift mutations , 2 nonsense mutations , and a second splice site mutation were also identified .
Consequently , 86 % of afibrinogenemia alleles analyzed to date have truncating mutations of FGA , though mutations in all 3 fibrinogen genes , FGG , FGA , and FGB , might be predicted to cause congenital afibrinogenemia . .
Myotonic dystrophy : the role of the CUG triplet repeats in splicing of a novel DMPK exon and altered cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoform ratios .
The mechanism by which ( CTG ) n expansion in the 3 UTR of the DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is unknown .
We identified four RNA splicing factors - - hnRNP C , U2AF ( U2 auxiliary factor ) , PTB ( polypyrimidine tract binding protein ) , and PSF ( PTB associated splicing factor ) - - that bind to two short regions 3 of the ( CUG ) n , and found a novel 3 DMPK exon resulting in an mRNA lacking the repeats .
We propose that the ( CUG ) n is an essential cis acting element for this splicing event .
In contrast to ( CUG ) n containing mRNAs , the novel isoform is not retained in the nucleus in DM cells , resulting in imbalances in relative levels of cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoforms and a new dominant effect of the mutation on DMPK . .
Expression and imprinting of MAGEL2 suggest a role in Prader - willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11 - q13 .
Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia , developmental delay and childhood - onset obesity .
Necdin , a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons , is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model .
In this study , we have characterized MAGEL2 ( also known as NDNL1 ) , a gene with 51 % amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region .
MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain , the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis .
MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain , and paternal - only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS - affected individual .
The orthologous mouse gene ( Magel2 ) is located within 150 kb of NDN , is imprinted with paternal - only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting , RT - PCR and whole - mount RNA in situ hybridization .
Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid - gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization .
We hypothesize that , although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS , loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS . .
Retinoschisin , the X - linked retinoschisis protein , is a secreted photoreceptor protein , and is expressed and released by Weri - Rb1 cells .
X - linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic - like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers , leading to visual deterioration in males .
Many missense and protein - truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating .
RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein , retinoschisin , which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function .
We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin , which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol , but multimers sized > 40 kDa under non - reducing conditions .
A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae .
We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA ( using in situ hybridization with riboprobes ) and retinoschisin ( using immunohistochemistry ) .
The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina .
Furthermore , differentiated retinoblastoma cells ( Weri - Rb1 cells ) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin .
These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo - receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers .
Thus , X - linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo - receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy . .
Study of the voltage - gated sodium channel beta 1 subunit gene ( SCN1B ) in the benign familial infantile convulsions syndrome ( BFIC ) .
Benign familial infantile convulsions ( BFIC ) is a rare autosomal dominant epilepsy syndrome .
This syndrome has been recently described in Italian and French pedigrees .
Patients present with partial , then generalized seizures , with onset at age three months .
The seizures usually spontaneously cease after one year without treatment , leaving no neurological abnormalities .
We have mapped BFIC to chromosome 19q in five Italian pedigrees .
The sodium channel beta1 subunit gene ( SCN1B ) maps to this candidate region and has been shown to be involved in one Australian pedigree with generalized epilepsy and febrile seizures " plus " ( GEFS + ) .
In this family , a missense mutation in SCN1B cosegregates with the GEFS + phenotype .
BFIC and GEFS + have clinical features in common , therefore SCN1B is a candidate gene for BFIC .
We studied SCN1B exons 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , using four SSCP methods in 10 Caucasian BFIC probands of Western Europe .
We found no exon variants .
One variant was identified in intron 5 ( IVS5 - 10C > G ) , which did not segregate with BFIC and was observed in 9 .
2 % controls .
A second variant in intron 5 was identified ( IVS5 + 30G > A ) .
It was rare , as not observed in controls , but not segregating with the BFIC phenotype .
Inactivation of germline mutant APC alleles by attenuated somatic mutations : a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis .
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor - suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .
Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early - onset colorectal cancer .
A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP ( AFAP ) phenotype , in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age .
Although a genotype - phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented , the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined .
We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele ( APC ( AS9 ) ) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 .
APC ( AS9 ) was found to down - regulate beta - catenin - regulated transcription , the major tumor - suppressor function of APC , as did the wild - type APC .
Mutation analysis showed that both APC ( AS9 ) and the wild - type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients .
Functional analysis showed that 4666insA , a common somatic mutation in APC ( AS9 ) in these tumors , did not inactivate the wild - type APC .
Our results indicate that carriers of APC ( AS9 ) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis .
However , these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC ( AS9 ) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild - type APC . .
Iron - dependent self - assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin : implications for Friedreich ataxia .
Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease .
Frataxin is a nuclear - encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes .
Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue ( Yfh1p ) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress .
Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA .
These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron - induced formation of free radicals .
The functional mechanism of frataxin , however , is still unknown .
We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p ( mYfh1p ) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro .
Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer ( 13 , 783 Da ) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self - associate .
Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1 .
1 MDa ( megadaltons ) and a diameter of 13 + / - 2 nm .
Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3 , 000 atoms of iron .
Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly .
Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer , indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form .
In yeast mitochondria , native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher - order species with a molecular weight > 600 , 000 .
After addition of ( 55 ) Fe to the medium , immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of ( 55 ) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p .
We propose that iron - dependent self - assembly of recombinant mYfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability . .
A mutation in the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of the FGD1 gene in an Italian family with faciogenital dysplasia ( Aarskog - Scott syndrome ) .
Aarskog - Scott Syndrome ( AAS ) is an X - linked disorder characterised by short stature and multiple facial , limb and genital abnormalities .
A gene , FGD1 , altered in a patient with AAS phenotype , has been identified and found to encode a protein with homology to Rho / Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Rho / Rac GEF ) .
However , since this original report on identification of a mutated FGD1 gene in an AAS patient , no additional mutations in the FGD1 gene have been described .
We analysed 13 independent patients with clinical diagnosis of AAS .
One patient presented a mutation that results in a nucleotide change in exon 10 of the FGD1 gene ( G2559 > A ) substituting a Gln for Arg in position 610 .
The mutation was found to segregate with the AAS phenotype in affected males and carrier females in the family of this patient .
Interestingly , Arg - 610 is located within one of the two pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains of the FGD1 gene and it corresponds to a highly conserved residue which has been involved in InsP binding in PH domains of other proteins .
The same residue is often mutated in the Brutons tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) gene in patients with an X - linked agammaglobulinemia .
The Arg610Gln mutation represents the first case of a mutation in the PH domain of the FGD1 gene and additional evidence that mutations in PH domains can be associated to human diseases . .
Amino - terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity .
Huntington disease ( HD ) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino - terminal region of huntingtin .
Despite its widespread expression , mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons .
Here we report that , in mutant mice expressing HD repeats , the production and aggregation of N - terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in HD - affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals .
N - terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons .
N - terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro .
The specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of N - terminal huntingtin in HD - affected striatal neurons , especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals , may contribute to the selective neuropathology of HD . .
BRCA1 is associated with a human SWI / SNF - related complex : linking chromatin remodeling to breast cancer .
Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene , BRCA1 , predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancers .
Using a combination of affinity - and conventional chromatographic techniques , we have isolated a predominant form of a multiprotein BRCA1 - containing complex from human cells displaying chromatin - remodeling activity .
Mass spectrometric sequencing of components of this complex indicated that BRCA1 is associated with a SWI / SNF - related complex .
We show that BRCA1 can directly interact with the BRG1 subunit of the SWI / SNF complex .
Moreover , p53 - mediated stimulation of transcription by BRCA1 was completely abrogated by either a dominant - negative mutant of BRG1 or the cancer - causing deletion in exon 11 of BRCA1 .
These findings reveal a direct function for BRCA1 in transcriptional control through modulation of chromatin structure . .
Asef , a link between the tumor suppressor APC and G - protein signaling .
The adenomatous polyposis coli gene ( APC ) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors .
Here the APC gene product is shown to bind through its armadillo repeat domain to a Rac - specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) , termed Asef .
Endogenous APC colocalized with Asef in mouse colon epithelial cells and neuronal cells .
Furthermore , APC enhanced the GEF activity of Asef and stimulated Asef - mediated cell flattening , membrane ruffling , and lamellipodia formation in MDCK cells .
These results suggest that the APC - Asef complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network , cell morphology and migration , and neuronal function . .
Function of an axonal chemoattractant modulated by metalloprotease activity .
The axonal chemoattractant netrin - 1 guides spinal commissural axons by activating its receptor DCC ( Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ) .
We have found that chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin - mediated axon outgrowth in vitro .
We have also found that DCC is a substrate for metalloprotease - dependent ectodomain shedding , and that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants .
Thus , potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons , and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors . .
Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat .
Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adult humans , results from expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK gene .
The mutant DMPK messenger RNA ( mRNA ) contains an expanded CUG repeat and is retained in the nucleus .
We have expressed an untranslated CUG repeat in an unrelated mRNA in transgenic mice .
Mice that expressed expanded CUG repeats developed myotonia and myopathy , whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not .
Thus , transcripts with expanded CUG repeats are sufficient to generate a DM phenotype .
This result supports a role for RNA gain of function in disease pathogenesis . .
Genomic rearrangements of the APC tumor - suppressor gene in familial adenomatous polyposis .
Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor - suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) .
Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single - nucleotide alterations , small insertions , or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene .
No well - characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described , and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear .
We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families .
Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements .
Two of these four rearrangements were complex , involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides .
Of these four rearrangements , one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14 .
The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14 .
Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level , it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14 .
These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually .
The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis .
The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations . .
Detection of a novel missense mutation and second recurrent mutation in the CACNA1A gene in individuals with EA - 2 and FHM .
Mutations in the brain specific P / Q type Ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene , CACNA1A , have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders , viz . episodic ataxia type 2 ( EA - 2 ) , familial hemiplegic migraine ( FHM ) and spinocerebellar ataxia 6 ( SCA6 ) .
For individuals with EA - 2 , the mutations described thus far are presumed to result in a truncated protein product .
Several different missense mutations have been identified in patients with FHM .
At least two of these mutations have been identified on two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes and thus represent recurrent mutations .
In the present study , we have screened several individuals for mutations in all 47 exons in the CACNA1A gene by single - strand conformation analysis .
We have characterised a novel missense mutation , G5260A , in exon 32 in a family segregating for EA - 2 .
The consequence of this mutation is an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the CACNA1A gene .
This represents the first point mutation not resulting in a proposed truncated protein .
Furthermore , this mutation has been detected in a family member with mild clinical signs including only migraine .
Additionally , a second previously identified recurrent muta tion , C2272T , in exon 16 has been discovered in a patient with FHM . .
Analbuminemia in a neonate .
A small - for - gestational - age infant , found to have analbuminemia in the neonatal period , is reported and the twelve cases recorded in the world literature are reviewed .
Patients lacking this serum protein are essentially asymptomatic , apart from minimal ankle edema and ease of fatigue .
Apparent compensatory mechanisms which come into play when serum albumin is low include prolonged half - life of albumin and transferrin , an increase in serum globulins , beta lipoprotein , and glycoproteins , arterial hypotension with reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure , and the ability to respond with rapid sodium and chloride diuresis in response to small volume changes .
Examination of plasma amino acids , an investigation not previously reported , revealed an extremely low plasma tryptophan level , a finding which may be important in view of the role of tryptophan in albumin synthesis . .
Histidinemia .
Classical and atypical form in siblings .
Two brothers , 6 and 13 years old , had histidinemia .
On the basis of clinical and biochemical observations , the younger boy was considered to have a classical type of the disease , while the older boy had an atypical form characterized by partial impairment of the skin histidase activity and a moderately prolonged half - life of blood histidine .
The mother is a heterozygous carrier , while the father and sister seem to be normal . .
Carrier detection of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency in fibroblasts and lymphocytes .
Pyruvate carboxylase ( E . C . 6 . 4 . 1 . 1 ) activity was determined in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from the family of a patient with hepatic , cerebral , renal cortical , leukocyte , and fibroblast pyruvate carboxylase deficiency ( PC Portland deficiency ) .
Lymphocyte activities were mother , 33 - - 39 % ; father , 11 - - 29 % ; brother , 82 - - 103 % ; and sister , 38 - - 48 % of the lowest normal .
Fibroblasts from the patients mother and father had 42 and 34 % , respectively , of the activity of the lowest normal .
These data demonstrate that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and that lymphocytes and fibroblasts can be used to detect carriers .
Neither pyruvate carboxylase nor mitochondrial PEPCK activity in lymphocytes was increased by a 21 - hr fast .
Glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase variants from Italian subjects associated with severe neonatal jaundice .
Screening for the G6PD deficiency was carried out at the Maternity Division of the Galliera Hospital in Genoa , Italy .
Two groups of subjects with hyperbilirubinaemia of non - immunological origin were examined ( a ) 302 newborn babies of Sardinian extraction ( on cord blood ) and ( b ) 201 newborn babies of south Italian ancestry ( on peripheral blood ) .
Among 503 subjects , 43 showed an enzyme deficiency ; in 39 the defect was of the Mediterranean type .
In one case , previously described , the enzyme was of the A - type .
In the remaining cases three different variants were identified .
In the present work these three cases , each with severe neonatal jaundice , are reported .
Their parents originated from Calabria , from Sardinia and from Sicily .
The abnormal enzymes are respectively designated as GdDcbrousse - like , GdGallura and GdAgrigento . .
Cytogenetic investigations in families with ataxia - telangiectasia .
Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from five Israeli - Moroccan families with ataxia - telangiectasia .
A total of 24 individuals , including seven propositi , was investigated .
Among the probands , significantly elevated rates of chromosome damage were observed in both blood and skin .
Skin fibroblasts of affected individuals showed several orders of magnitude more chromosome breakage than lymphocytes .
Increased rates of chromosome damage were also observed in the fibroblasts of some phenotypically normal family members ( obligate heterozygotes and sibs ) when compared to normal controls .
An apparent abnormal clone of cells , possessing a large acrocentric marker chromosome ( 14q + ) , was observed in varying proportions among cells of all the propositi ( 2 - 5 % of lymphocytes ; 1 - 9 % of fibroblasts ) . .
Prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease .
Two pregnancies at risk for Wolman disease were monitored by assay and electrophoresis of acid lipase in cultured amniotic - fluid cells .
Cells from patient 1 had 5 % of control levels of acid lipase , using 14C - triolein as substrate ; however , when artificial substrates ( esters of 4 - methylumbelliferone and p - nitrophenol ) were used to measure acid lipase , these cells had 30 % of control levels .
Electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the absence of the A form of acid lipase , consistent with the diagnosis of Wolman disease .
Analysis of fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination of this pregnancy confirmed the diagnosis .
Assay of fetal - skin fibroblasts with 14C - triolein , as well as with artificial substrates , showed marked deficiency of acid lipase activity .
Electrophoresis of fetal - tissue extracts also demonstrated the absence of the A form of acid lipase .
Amniotic - fluid cells from patient 2 showed normal levels of acid lipase with all substrates tested ; the electrophoretic pattern of acid lipase was normal .
The results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of Wolman disease be made using the radioassay of acid lipase and / or electrophoresis . .
Malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia - telangiectasia .
Ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals .
Heterozygotes for the gene for A - T are thought to comprise about 1 % of the general population and , therefore , it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers .
Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A - T , although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test .
For this reason , we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A - T to that expected in a random sample of the general population .
There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75 , compared to 42 .
6 expected ( p less than 0 . 02 ) .
For A - T heterozygotes younger than age 45 , the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population .
A - T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5 % of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45 .
The incidence of ovarian , gastric , and biliary system carcinomas and of leukemia and lymphoma was increased in these A - T families .
Other neoplasms that may be associated with this gene in heterozygotes include pancreatic , basal cell , colonic , breast , and cervical carcinomas .
Striking prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis in " healthy " w27 positive males and females .
Ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed once or twice in each 1000 males and one tenth as frequently in females , but the true prevalence is unknown .
Indentification of genetic marker , HL - A W27 , for susceptible persons has provided a tool facilitating epidemiologic studies and allowing identification of " control " populations without the marker .
Evaluation by postal questionnaires , and pelvic radiography of 78 HL - A 27W - positive blood donors selected from a group of apparently healthy subjects revealed 14 who satisfied the criteria for definite ankylosing spondylitis .
The prevalence was similar in both sexes .
One hundred and twenty - six W27 - negative controls matched for race , sex , and age failed to yield a single case .
For a person of either sex with HL - A W27 , there appears to be about a 20 per cent chance that ankylosing spondylitis will develop , suggesting a prevalence of 10 to 15 per thousand .
Hitherto accepted figures may underestimate the frequency by a factor of 10 to 20 . .
Analbuminemia in an American Indian girl .
Analbuminemia was fortuitously detected in a nonedematous 12 - year - old American Indian girl with atopic dermatitis , mild bronchial asthma , a mild seizure disorder , and hyperlipoproteinemia with a corneal arcus .
Immunologic methods revealed trace amounts ( 17 mg / 100 ml ) of apparently normal serum albumin .
The patients parents were remotely related .
The pedigree and clinical findings were compatible with autosomal recessive transmission of analbuminemia .
Heterozygotes had subnormal levels of serum albumin .
The Gc - locus is closely linked to the structural albumin locus .
Gc - protein levels were normal in the patient and together with normal chromosomal banding studies make it unlikely that a chromosomal deletion caused analbuminemia .
Gc - types in the family were compatible with , but did not prove , linkage of analbuminemia to the Gc - locus .
These findings suggest a " thalassemia " - like mutation for this disorder . .
Deletion of the KIT and PDGFRA genes in a patient with piebaldism .
We have previously shown that human piebaldism results from mutations of the KIT gene , which encodes the receptor for the mast / stem cell growth factor and is located in chromosome segment 4q12 .
Using DNA of a patient with piebaldism , mental retardation , and multiple congenital anomalies associated with a 46 , XY , del ( 4 ) ( q12q21 . 1 ) karyotype , we carried out quantitative Southern blot hybridization analyses of the KIT gene and the adjacent PDGFRA ( platelet - derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit ) genes .
The patient was hemizygous for both the KIT and PDGFRA genes , indicating that both of these genes are included within the deleted region .
Therefore , deletion of the KIT and PDGFRA genes may account for the piebald phenotype in this patient .
A germ line mutation within the coding sequence for the putative 5 - phosphoribosyl - 1 - pyrophosphate binding site of hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) in a Lesch - Nyhan patient : missense mutations within a functionally important region probably cause disease .
Lesch - Nyhan syndrome caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) is the result of a heterogeneous group of germ line mutations .
Identification of each mutant gene provides valuable information as to the type of mutation that occurs spontaneously .
We report here a newly identified HPRT mutation in a Japanese patient with Lesch - Nyhan syndrome .
This gene , designated HPRT Tokyo , had a single nucleotide change from G to A , as identified by sequencing cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction .
Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line .
This mutation would lead to an amino acid substitution of Asp for Gly at the amino acid position 140 located within the putative 5 - phosphoribosyl - 1 - pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) binding region .
Missense mutations in human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region .
However , a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line HPRT gene , but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause disease .
The probability that a mutation will cause disease tends to be higher when the missense mutation is within a functionally important sequence . .
Characterisation of a new rare fragile site easily confused with the fragile X .
A new fragile site ( FRAXE ) in Xq28 is described .
It appears to be a typical folate sensitive fragile site .
The fragile site is not associated with mental retardation , it does not give abnormal results when subjected to Southern analysis with probe pfxa3 which detects the unstable DNA sequence characteristic of fragile X syndrome .
In situ hybridization mapping locates the fragile site between 150 kb and 600 kb distal to FRAXA .
The distinction between the two fragile sites is important clinically since cytogenetic detection of FRAXE , without molecular analysis , could result in misdiagnosis of fragile X syndrome . .
The Norrie disease gene maps to a 150 kb region on chromosome Xp11 . 3 .
Norrie disease is a human X - linked recessive disorder of unknown etiology characterized by congenital blindness , sensory neural deafness and mental retardation .
This disease gene was previously linked to the DXS7 ( L1 . 28 ) locus and the MAO genes in band Xp11 .
3 3 .
We report here fine physical mapping of the obligate region containing the Norrie disease gene ( NDP ) defined by a recombination and by the smallest submicroscopic chromosomal deletion associated with Norrie disease identified to date .
Analysis , using in addition two overlapping YAC clones from this region , allowed orientation of the MAOA and MAOB genes in a 5 - 3 - 3 - 5 configuration .
A recombination event between a ( GT ) n polymorphism in intron 2 of the MAOB gene and the NDP locus , in a family previously reported to have a recombination between DXS7 and NDP , delineates a flanking marker telomeric to this disease gene .
An anonymous DNA probe , dc12 , present in one of the YACs and in a patient with a submicroscopic deletion which includes MAOA and MAOB but not L1 .
28 , serves as a flanking marker centromeric to the disease gene .
An Alu - PCR fragment from the right arm of the MAO YAC ( YMAO . AluR ) is not deleted in this patient and also delineates the centromeric extent of the obligate disease region .
The apparent order of these loci is telomere .
DXS7 - MAOA - MAOB - NDP - dc12 - YMAO DXS7 - MAOA - MAOB - NDP - dc12 - YMAO .
AluR . centromere .
Together these data define the obligate region containing the NDP gene to a chromosomal segment less than 150 kb .
Molecular basis of phenylketonuria and related hyperphenylalaninemias : mutations and polymorphisms in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene .
Mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups .
These mutations all exhibit a high degree of association with specific restriction fragment - length polymorphism haplotypes at the PAH locus .
About 50 of these mutations are single - base substitutions , including six nonsense mutations and eight splicing mutations , with the remainder being missense mutations .
One splicing mutation results in a 3 amino acid in - frame insertion .
Two or 3 large deletions , 2 single codon deletions , and 2 single base deletions have been found .
Twelve of the missense mutations apparently result from the methylation and subsequent deamination of highly mutagenic CpG dinucleotides .
Recurrent mutation has been observed at several of these sites , producing associations with different haplotypes in different populations .
About half of all missense mutations have been examined by in vitro expression analysis , and a significant correlation has been observed between residual PAH activity and disease phenotype .
Since continuing advances in molecular methodologies have dramatically accelerated the rate in which new mutations are being identified and characterized , this register of mutations will be updated periodically . .
A glycine250 - - > aspartate substitution in the alpha - subunit of hexosaminidase A causes juvenile - onset Tay - Sachs disease in a Lebanese - Canadian family .
The mutation causing juvenile Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) in two sibs of Lebanese - Maronite origin is described .
An mRNA - containing extract of cultured fibroblasts obtained from one of the probands was used as a template to amplify the coding sequence of the hexosaminidase A ( Hex A ) alpha - subunit .
Sequencing of amplified cDNA fragments revealed a single alteration , guanine to adenine at nt 749 creating a G250D mutation .
The mutation introduces a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Eco RV , permitting identification of heterozygotes for this allele following PCR amplification and Eco RV digestion of exon 7 sequences from genomic DNA templates .
In order to test the effect of this substitution , an in vitro mutagenized cDNA construct was introduced into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into monkey Cos - 1 cells separately or along with a beta - cDNA expression vector .
When the mutant alpha - cDNA was the only gene introduced into COS cells no enzymatic activity above endogenous COS cell activity was detected .
Cotransfection of normal alpha - cDNA and beta - cDNA followed by immunoprecipitation of human Hex A resulted in 20 - fold increase in the ratio between positive and negative ( mock transfection ) control values .
This allowed the detection of some residual activity ( 12 % of the positive control ) when the mutant alpha - cDNA replaced its wild - type counterpart .
The predicted protein environment in which the mutation occurs is compared to that of the adult - onset Tay - Sachs disease mutation caused by a Gly269 - - > Ser substitution in exon 7 .

Novel Tay - Sachs disease mutations from China .
We describe three HEXA mutations associated with infantile Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) in three unrelated nonconsanguineous Chinese families .
Novel mutations were found in two of these families .
The third is a previously reported mutation ( G - - > A transition at nt 1444 ) ( Nakano et al . , 1988 ) .
Direct sequencing of PCR products identified a novel insertion of an A after nt 547 in family 1 .
This change generates an early termination codon 6 bp downstream from the insertion site .
Allele - specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity in the proband .
Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of amplified exon 13 revealed a T - - > C transition at nt 1453 with the corresponding amino acid substitution W485R in the second family .
This mutation creates an Fnu4HI restriction site .
The proband is homozygous for this allele .
When the site - specific mutagenized alpha cDNA carrying the T - - > C transition at nt 1453 was expressed in COS 1 cells hexosaminidase S activity was not detectable above background .
A G - - > A transition at nt 1444 ( exon 13 ) corresponding to the E482K substitution was found in the third family .
This mutation occurs at a CpG dinucleotide .
It has been reported in an Italian TSD proband and causes defective intracellular transport of the alpha - subunit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus .
Two missense mutations causing mild hyperphenylalaninemia associated with DNA haplotype 12 .
The genetic defects responsible for most phenylketonuria ( PKU ) and hyperphenylalaninemia ( HPA ) cases are located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) gene .
Approximately 50 - 60 mutations have been reported in Caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities .
Most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes , as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the PAH gene .
We hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish PKU / HPA population , since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild HPA .
Sequence analysis revealed a C - to - G transversion at the second base of codon 322 , resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine , in four mutant haplotype 12 genes , and a G - to - A transition at the second base of codon 408 , resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine , in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes .
These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles .
Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant PAH enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations , although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities .
The A322G mutant PAH had about 75 % and the R408Q mutant PAH about 55 % of the wild - type PAH enzyme activity .
These in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant PAH enzymes produced in the same expression system .

In vitro and in vivo correlations for I65T and M1V mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus .
Mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) locus are the major cause of hyperphenylalaninemia .
We have previously described four mutations ( M1V , IVS12nt1 , R408W , and S349P ) at the PAH locus in French Canadians with ancestry in eastern Quebec .
Here we report ( 1 ) identification of another mutation , on a haplotype 9 chromosome , which converts codon 65 from isoleucine ( ATT ) to threonine ( ACT ) , ( 2 ) expression analysis of the I65T mutation in COS cells demonstrating 75 % loss of both immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity , and ( 3 ) expression analysis of the most prevalent PKU allele ( M1V ) in eastern Quebec , showing nondetectable levels of PAH protein and activity , a finding compatible with a mutation in the translation initiation codon .
Homozygosity for M1V and codominant inheritance of I65T / R408W were both associated with classical phenylketonuria . .
Molecular basis of hexosaminidase A deficiency and pseudodeficiency in the Berks County Pennsylvania Dutch .
Following the birth of two infants with Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) , a non - Jewish , Pennsylvania Dutch kindred was screened for TSD carriers using the biochemical assay .
A high frequency of individuals who appeared to be TSD heterozygotes was detected ( Kelly et al . , 1975 ) .
Clinical and biochemical evidence suggested that the increased carrier frequency was due to at least two altered alleles for the hexosaminidase A alpha - subunit .
We now report two mutant alleles in this Pennsylvania Dutch kindred , and one polymorphism .
One allele , reported originally in a French TSD patient ( Akli et al . , 1991 ) , is a GT - - > AT transition at the donor splice - site of intron 9 .
The second , a C - - > T transition at nucleotide 739 ( Arg247Trp ) , has been shown by Triggs - Raine et al .
( 1992 ) to be a clinically benign " pseudodeficient " allele associated with reduced enzyme activity against artificial substrate .
Finally , a polymorphism [ G - - > A ( 759 ) ] , which leaves valine at codon 253 unchanged , is described .
A mutation common in non - Jewish Tay - Sachs disease : frequency and RNA studies .
Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha - subunit of the lysosomal enzyme , beta - N - acetylhexosaminidase A ( Hex A ) .
We have discovered that a Tay - Sachs mutation , IVS - 9 + 1 G - - > A , first detected by Akli et al .
( Genomics 11 124 - 134 , 1991 ) , is a common disease allele in non - Jewish Caucasians ( 10 / 58 alleles examined ) .
A PCR - based diagnostic test , which detects an NlaIII site generated by the mutation , revealed a frequency among enzyme - defined carriers of 9 / 64 ( 14 % ) .
Most of those carrying the allele trace their origins to the United Kingdom , Ireland , or Western Europe .
It was not identified among 12 Black American TSD alleles or in any of 18 Ashkenazi Jewish , enzyme - defined carriers who did not carry any of the mutations common to this population .
No normally spliced RNA was detected in PCR products generated from reverse transcription of RNA carrying the IVS - 9 mutation .
Instead , the low levels of mRNA from this allele were comprised of aberrant species resulting from the use of either of two cryptic donor sites , one truncating exon 9 and the other within IVS - 9 , spliced to exon 10 .
Numerous additional splice products were detected , most involving skipping of one or more surrounding exons .
Together with a recently identified allele responsible for Hex A pseudodeficiency ( Triggs - Raine et al . Am J Hum Genet , 1992 ) , these two alleles accounted for almost 50 % ( 29 / 64 ) of TSD or carrier alleles ascertained by enzyme screening tests in non - Jewish Caucasians . .
Aberrant splicing of the CHM gene is a significant cause of choroideremia .
Choroideremia ( CHM ) is an X - linked progressive degeneration of the choroid and retina .
12 % of unrelated male patients carry deletions of the partially cloned CHM gene .
In Finland , there are more than 120 living CHM patients belonging to eight apparently unrelated pedigrees .
Molecular deletions involving the CHM gene have been detected in three families .
We have screened the remaining five families for point mutations .
In one large family a single nucleotide ( T ) insertion into the donor splice site of exon C leads to two aberrantly spliced mRNAs both producing a premature stop codon .
The mutation can be assayed easily by amplification and digestion with Msel .
Our findings provide additional evidence for the pathogenetic role of CHM mutations and provide a diagnostic tool for one fifth of the worlds known CHM patients . .
Germline intronic and exonic mutations in the Wilms ' tumour gene ( WT1 ) affecting urogenital development .
Denys - Drash syndrome is a rare human developmental disorder affecting the urogenital system and leading to renal failure , intersex disorders and Wilms tumour .
In this report , four individuals with this syndrome are described carrying germline point mutations in the Wilms tumour suppressor gene , WT1 .
Three of these mutations were in the zinc finger domains of WT1 .
The fourth occurred within intron 9 , preventing splicing at one of the alternatively chosen splice donor sites of exon 9 when assayed in vitro .
These results provide genetic evidence for distinct functional roles of the WT1 isoforms in urogenital development . .
Characterization of the myotonic dystrophy region predicts multiple protein isoform - encoding mRNAs .
The mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as an expansion of a polymorphic CTG - repeat in a gene encoding protein kinase activity .
Brain and heart transcripts of the DM - kinase ( DMR - B15 ) gene are subject to alternative RNA splicing in both human and mouse .
The unstable [ CTG ] 5 - 30 motif is found uniquely in humans , although the flanking nucleotides are also present in mouse .
Characterization of the DM region of both species reveals another active gene ( DMR - N9 ) in close proximity to the kinase gene .
DMR - N9 transcripts , mainly expressed in brain and testis , possess a single , large open reading frame , but the function of its protein product is unknown .
Clinical manifestation of DM may be caused by the expanded CTG - repeat compromising the ( alternative ) expression of DM - kinase or DMR - N9 proteins . .
Fragile X syndrome without CCG amplification has an FMR1 deletion .
We describe a patient with typical clinical features of the fragile X syndrome , but without cytogenetic expression of the fragile X or an amplified CCG trinucleotide repeat fragment .
The patient has a previously uncharacterized submicroscopic deletion encompassing the CCG repeat , the entire FMR1 gene and about 2 .
5 megabases of flanking sequences .
This finding confirms that the fragile X phenotype can exist , without amplification of the CCG repeat or cytogenetic expression of the fragile X , and that fragile X syndrome is a genetically homogeneous disorder involving FMR1 .
We also found random X - inactivation in the mother of the patient who was shown to be a carrier of this deletion .
Cloning of the Huntington disease region in yeast artificial chromosomes .
The gene responsible for Huntington disease has been localized to a 2 .
5 million base pair ( Mb ) region between the loci D4S10 and D4S168 on the short arm of chromosome 4 .
As part of a strategy to clone the HD gene on the basis of its chromosomal location , we isolated genomic DNA from the HD region as a set of overlapping yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) clones .
Twenty - eight YAC clones were identified by screening human YAC libraries with twelve PCR - based sequence - tagged sites ( STSs ) from the region .
We assembled the YAC clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of DNA probes from the HD region , including the STSs .
In addition , we isolated the ends of the human DNA inserts of most of the YAC clones to assist in the construction of the contig .
Although almost half of the YACs appear to contain chimeric inserts and several contain internal deletions or other rearrangements , we were able to obtain over 2 .
2 Mb of the HD region in YACs , including one continuous segment of 2 .
0 Mb covering the region that most likely contains the HD gene .
Ten of the twenty eight YAC clones comprise a minimal set spanning the 2 .
2 Mb .
These clones provide reagents for the complete characterization of this region of the genome and for the eventual isolation of the HD gene .
Characterization of a YAC containing part or all of the Norrie disease locus .
It has been shown from pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) that the monoamine oxidase genes A and B ( MAOA & MAOB ) and DXS7 loci are physically very close .
We have therefore extended studies on their relationship through the characterisation of a 650 kb YAC isolated using L1 .
28 ( recognising the DXS7 locus ) as a probe .
Restriction mapping of the YAC indicates that it contains both MAOA and MAOB genes in addition to the DXS7 locus .
The map derived from the YL1 .
28 - YAC is compatible both with the map from an independently derived YAC carrying MAOA and B genes and with the long range genomic map for the region .
A series of subclones prepared from a phage library ( lambda DASH II ) of the YAC have been characterised and have been employed to determine the end point of the deletion of a Norrie disease ( NDP ) patient who has been shown to lack both DXS7 and MAO coding sequences .
The pattern of retention of subclones in the deletion patient place the end point of the deletion within 30 - 130 kb of the proximal end of the YAC .
By combining the data with established recombination analysis , we provide evidence that all or part of the NDP lies in the interval of approximately 250kb within the YAC .
Both mutations in G6PD A - are necessary to produce the G6PD deficient phenotype .
The high prevalence of glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency in African populations is due almost entirely to the enzyme variant A - , which differs from the wild - type G6PD B by two amino acid replacements , 68 Val - - > Met and 126 Asn - - > Asp .
The non - deficient polymorphic variant G6PD A contains only the mutation 126 Asn - - > Asp .
The frequencies of the G6PD A and of the G6PD A - genes in parts of Africa are both about 0 .
2 .
The 68 Val - - > Met mutation has not been found in a B background .
This could be because the 68 Val - - > Met mutation happened to arise in an A gene in the first instance , or because the 68 Val - - > Met mutation alone is not sufficient to cause G6PD deficiency .
We have approached this question by producing G6PD B , A , A - , and G6PD 68 Val - - > Met in a bacterial expression system and analysing their biochemical properties .
With each single mutation we found a slight decrease in both the specific activity and the yield of enzyme when compared to G6PD B .
When both mutations were introduced together , there was a roughly additive effect on specific activity , but a much more drastic effect on enzyme yield ( 4 % of normal ) .
This synergistic effect was also demonstrated on thermal stability , especially at low NADP concentrations .
Comparable results were produced when the replacement 119 Gln - - > Glu was studied instead of 126 Asn - - > Asp .
We infer that the coexistence of the two mutations is responsible for enzyme deficiency in G6PD A - because they act synergistically in causing instability of the enzyme .
Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N ( SNRPN ) , an expressed gene in the Prader - Willi syndrome critical region .
Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is associated with paternally derived chromosomal deletions in region 15q11 - 13 or with maternal disomy for chromosome 15 .
Therefore , loss of the expressed paternal alleles of maternally imprinted genes must be responsible for the PWS phenotype .
We have mapped the gene encoding the small nuclear RNA associated polypeptide SmN ( SNRPN ) to human chromosome 15q12 and a processed pseudogene SNRPNP1 to chromosome region 6pter - p21 .
Furthermore , SNRPN was mapped to the minimal deletion interval that is critical for PWS .
The fact that the mouse Snrpn gene is maternally imprinted in brain suggests that loss of the paternally derived SNRPN allele may be involved in the PWS phenotype . .
The presence of two different infantile Tay - Sachs disease mutations in a Cajun population .
A study was undertaken to characterize the mutation ( s ) responsible for Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) in a Cajun population in southwest Louisiana and to identify the origins of these mutations .
Eleven of 12 infantile TSD alleles examined in six families had the beta - hexosaminidase A ( Hex A ) alpha - subunit exon 11 insertion mutation that is present in approximately 70 % of Ashkenazi Jewish TSD heterozygotes .
The mutation in the remaining allele was a single - base transition in the donor splice site of the alpha - subunit intron 9 .
To determine the origins of these two mutations in the Cajun population , the TSD carrier status was enzymatically determined for 90 members of four of the six families , and extensive pedigrees were constructed for all carriers .
A single ancestral couple from France was found to be common to most of the carriers of the exon 11 insertion .
Pedigree data suggest that this mutation has been in the Cajun population since its founding over 2 centuries ago and that it may be widely distributed within the population .
In contrast , the intron 9 mutation apparently was introduced within the last century and probably is limited to a few Louisiana families . .
Mutations in the candidate gene for Norrie disease .
Recently , we and others have isolated a candidate gene for X linked Norrie disease ( ND ) which was found to be deleted or disrupted in several patients .
As a prerequisite for the identification of point mutations in the ND gene we have established the exon - intron structure of this gene .
In 17 unrelated patients and 15 controls , PCR products derived from the promoter region , exons 1 and 2 as well as the coding part of exon 3 were analysed with the single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique .
In 12 patients altered PCR fragments were detected which were studied in detail by direct sequencing .
Eleven different mutations were found , and all but one are likely to give rise to significant structural changes in the predicted protein .
These findings , and the absence of functionally relevant base changes in healthy controls , emphasize the causal role of this candidate gene in Norrie disease and pave the way for reliable diagnosis and carrier detection . .
Detection of a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene by multiple SSCP .
A combination of multiplex PCR with the single strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique was employed to screen for point mutations in the human dystrophin gene .
Co - amplification of 11 exons from genomic DNA of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD / BMD ) patients with no deletion or duplication was performed and the samples subjected to multiple SSCP analysis .
We report the case of a nonsense mutation in a Duchenne patient identified by this approach .
The mutation introduces a termination codon within exon 8 of the dystrophin gene .
It is predicted to cause a very premature translational termination accounting for the severe phenotype observed .
The patient inherited this mutation from his mother .
In addition the analysis revealed 5 polymorphisms useful for internal control . .
Proliferation - related expression of p19 / nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase .
High level expression of the nm23 - H1 gene , which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase , has been found to correlate with diminished metastasis in some tumors but not in others .
We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23 - H1 gene in two - dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19 / nm23 .
In neuroblastoma , higher levels of p19 / nm23 , which are associated with amplification of the N - myc oncogene , large tumor mass , and metastasis , were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease .
Because of the variable expression of nm23 - H1 in different tumors , we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation .
The levels of p19 / nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells .
The amount of p19 / nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis .
In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia , p19 / nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes .
Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin , which inhibits proliferation , blocked the increase in p19 / nm23 ; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL - 60 with dimethylsulfoxide , which induces terminal differentiation , resulted in diminished levels of p19 / nm23 .
Our data therefore provide evidence that nm23 - H1 expression is related to cell proliferative activity . .
An intrachromosomal insertion causing 5q22 deletion and familial adenomatous polyposis coli in two generations .
We report familial adenomatous polyposis coli ( FAPC ) with epidermoid cysts , osteomata , and areas of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium ( CHRPEs ) in a male patient and his maternal aunt , both of whom suffered a mild to moderate degree of mental handicap .
Both had an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 ( del ( 5 ) ( q22q23 . 2 ) ) .
Two other normal family members had the underlying direct insertion of chromosome 5 ( dir ins ( 5 ) ( q31 . 3q22q23 3q22q23 . 2 ) ) .
Molecular genetic and fluorescent hybridisation studies have shown that loci D5S37 and D5S98 are outside the deletion whereas loci detected by probes EF5 .
44 and YN5 .
48 are lost .
As expected , the molecular analyses indicate loss of one allele at the MCC and APC loci .
The APC gene is located within band 5q22 .
Familial direct insertions should be considered as a cause of recurrent microdeletion syndromes .
Chromosome mapping of the rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase beta - subunit gene in mouse and human : tight linkage to the Huntington disease region ( 4p16 . 3 ) .
The retinal degeneration mouse ( gene symbol , rd ) is an animal model for certain forms of human hereditary retinopathies .
Recent findings of a nonsense mutation in the rd mouse PDE beta - subunit gene ( Pdeb ) prompted us to investigate the chromosome locations of the mouse and human genes .
We have utilized backcross analysis in mice to verify and define more precisely the location of the Pdeb locus 6 .
1 + / - 2 .
3 cM distal of Mgsa on mouse chromosome 5 .
We have determined that the human gene ( PDEB ) maps to 4p16 .
3 , very close to the Huntington disease ( HD ) region .
Analysis of the comparative map for mice and humans shows that the mouse homologue of the HD gene will reside on chromosome 5 .
Linkage of the mouse Pdeb locus with other homologues in the human 4p16 .
3 region is maintained but gene order is not , suggesting at least three possible sites for the corresponding mouse HD gene .
Coincident Kaposi sarcoma and T - cell lymphoma in a patient with the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome .
A 24 year old male with a history of eczema , recurrent mild infections , and thrombocytopenia consistent with the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) presented with a mediastinal mass , generalized lymphadenopathy , splenomegaly , and severe thrombocytopenia .
Studies of immune function including immunoglobulin levels and T - cell subsets were normal .
Furthermore , his T lymphocytes proliferated normally in response to phytohemagglutinin , concanavalin A , and the combination of neuraminidase / galactose oxidase .
However , their proliferative responses to anti - CD43 antibody and periodate were diminished , consistent with the clinical diagnosis of WAS .
An initial inguinal lymph node biopsy surprisingly revealed Kaposi sarcoma .
However , following splenectomy to increase the platelet count , biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed T - cell large cell lymphoma .
Studies of biopsied tissue for the presence of Epstein - Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative , as were studies of blood , including the polymerase chain reaction , for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
This is the first report of Kaposi sarcoma arising in a patient with a congenital immunodeficiency syndrome .
Although Kaposi sarcoma can arise in the face of the severe immunosuppression that follows allograft transplantation and in patients infected with HIV , we postulate that longevity in the face of mild immunosuppression was the major factor in the development of Kaposi sarcoma in this patient . .
The APC gene , responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis , is mutated in human gastric cancer .
Although gastric cancer is the most common cancer in the world , genetic changes during its carcinogenesis are not well understood .
Since some gastric cancers are considered to originate from the intestinal metaplasia , it is likely that the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene , the mutation of which causes adenomatous polyps in the colon , is associated with carcinogenesis of gastric cancer .
Based on this idea , DNAs isolated from gastric cancers were examined by means of a RNase protection analysis coupled with polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products .
By screening nearly one - half of the coding region of the APC gene in 44 tumors , somatic mutations were detected in three tumors a missense mutation , a nonsense mutation , and a 5 - base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift which causes truncation of the gene product .
These results suggest that the mutation of the APC gene also plays an important role during the carcinogenesis of at least some gastric cancers . .
A 71 - kilodalton protein is a major product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in brain and other nonmuscle tissues .
The known Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene products , the muscle - and brain - type dystrophin isoforms , are 427 - kDa proteins translated from 14 - kilobase ( kb ) mRNAs .
Recently we described a 6 .
5 - kb mRNA that also is transcribed from the DMD gene .
Cloning and in vitro transcription and translation of the entire coding region show that the 6 .
5 - kb mRNA encodes a 70 .
8 - kDa protein that is a major product of the DMD gene .
It contains the C - terminal and the cysteine - rich domains of dystrophin , seven additional amino acids at the N terminus , and some modifications formed by alternative splicing in the C - terminal domain .
It lacks the entire large domain of spectrin - like repeats and the actin - binding N - terminal domain of dystrophin .
This protein is the major DMD gene product in brain and other nonmuscle tissues but is undetectable in skeletal muscle extracts .
Correlation between the location of germ - line mutations in the APC gene and the number of colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis patients .
Recently we have isolated the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene which causes familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , and its germ - line mutations in a substantial number of FAP patients have been identified .
On the basis of this information , we compared the location of germ - line mutations in the APC gene in 22 unrelated patients ( 12 of whom have been reported previously ) with the number of colorectal polyps developed in FAP patients ; 17 were sparse types and five were profuse types .
All but one of the mutations were considered to cause truncation of the gene product by frame - shift due to deletion ( 14 cases ) or nonsense mutation ( seven cases ) .
The location of the germ - line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types ; germ - line mutations in five FAP patients with profuse polyps were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464 , whereas mutations in 17 FAP patients with fewer polyps were observed in the other regions of the APC gene .
The result suggests that the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients may be associated with a difference in the stability or biological function of the truncated APC protein . .
Identification and rapid detection of three Tay - Sachs mutations in the Moroccan Jewish population .
Infantile Tay - Sachs disease ( TSD ) is caused by mutations in the HEXA gene that result in the complete absence of beta - hexosaminidase A activity .
It is well known that an elevated frequency of TSD mutations exists among Ashkenazi Jews .
More recently it has become apparent that elevated carrier frequencies for TSD also occur in several other ethnic groups , including Moroccan Jews , a subgroup of Sephardic Jews .
Elsewhere we reported an in - frame deletion of one of the two adjacent phenylalanine codons at position 304 or 305 ( delta F304 / 305 ) in one HEXA allele of a Moroccan Jewish TSD patient and in three obligate carriers from six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families .
We have now identified two additional mutations within exon 5 of the HEXA gene that account for the remaining TSD alleles in the patient and carriers .
One of the mutations is a novel C - to - G transversion , resulting in a replacement of Tyr180 by a stop codon .
The other mutation is a G - to - A transition resulting in an Arg170 - to - Gln substitution .
This mutation is at a CpG site in a Japanese infant with Tay - Sachs disease and was described elsewhere .
Analysis of nine obligate carriers from seven unrelated families showed that four harbor the delta F304 / 305 mutation , two the Arg170 - - - - Gln mutation , and one the Tyr180 - - - - Stop mutation .
We also have developed rapid , nonradioactive assays for the detection of each mutation , which should be helpful for carrier screening . .
Molecular characterization of glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency by natural and amplification created restriction sites : five mutations account for most G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan .
We have developed a rapid and simple method to diagnose the molecular defects of glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency in Chinese in Taiwan .
This method involves the selective amplification of a DNA fragment from human G6PD gene with specific oligonucleotide primers followed by digestion with restriction enzymes that recognize artificially created or naturally occurring restriction sites .
Ninety - four Chinese males with G6PD deficiency were studied .
The results show that 50 % ( 47 of 94 ) were G to T mutation at nucleotide ( nt ) 1376 , 21 .
3 % ( 20 of 94 ) were G to A mutation at nt 1388 , 7 .
4 % ( 7 of 94 ) were A to G mutation at nt 493 , 7 .
4 % ( 7 of 94 ) were A to G mutation at nt 95 , 4 .
2 % ( 4 of 94 ) were C to T mutation at nt 1024 , 1 .
1 % ( 1 of 94 ) was G to T mutation at nt 392 , and 1 .
1 % ( 1 of 94 ) was G to A mutation at nt 487 .
These results show that the former five mutations account for more than 90 % of G6PD deficiency cases in Taiwan .
Aside from showing that G to T change at nt 1376 is the most common mutation , our research indicates that nt 493 mutation is a frequent mutation among Chinese in Taiwan .
We compared G6PD activity among different mutations , without discovering significant differences between them .
Eight novel inactivating germ line mutations at the APC gene identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis .
Familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is a dominantly inherited condition predisposing to colorectal cancer .
The recent isolation of the responsible gene ( adenomatous polyposis coli or APC ) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals .
Previous authors have used the RNase protection assay and the single - strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations .
In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) .
DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons ( 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and part of 15 ) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts .
The results reported here indicate that ( 1 ) familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations ; ( 2 ) all the mutations found in this study are chain terminating ; and ( 3 ) DGGE represents a rapid and sensitive technique for the detection of mutations in the unusually large APC gene .
An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well - characterized , unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype - phenotype correlations .
On the other hand , the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory .
Nevertheless , the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13 .
Such intragenic polymorphisms offer a practical approach to a more rapid procedure for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP by linkage analysis in informative families . .
Yeast artificial chromosomes for the molecular analysis of the familial polyposis APC gene region .
Two yeast artificial chromosomes ( YACs ) spanning a total distance of 1 .
1 megabase pairs of DNA around the MCC ( for mutated in colorectal carcinoma ) and APC ( for adenomatous polyposis coli ) genes at 5q21 have been isolated and characterized .
Starting from the MCC gene , a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene .
To this end , YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5 - specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning .
The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions .
This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs .
This YAC has been shown to contain the entire APC gene , in addition to a significant portion of DNA flanking the 5 end of the gene , and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor - derived cell lines .
Inherited WT1 mutation in Denys - Drash syndrome .
Patients with the Denys - Drash syndrome ( Wilms tumor , genital anomalies , and nephropathy ) have been demonstrated to carry de novo constitutional mutations in WT1 , the Wilms tumor gene at chromosome 11p13 .
We report three new cases , two carrying a previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation and one with a novel WT1 exon 8 mutation .
However , unlike patients in previous reports , one of our three patients inherited the affected allele from his phenotypically unaffected father .
This observation indicates that the WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated in over one - half of the patients with the Denys - Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance .
Consequently , familial studies in patients affected by this syndrome are recommended . .
Submicroscopic deletions at the WAGR locus , revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization .
Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) with biotin - labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the WAGR ( Wilms tumor , aniridia , genitourinary abnormalities , and mental retardation ) locus .
We have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney , only revealed at surgery .
The mother , who has aniridia , was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene ( AN2 ) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene ( WT1 ) .
This is therefore a rare case of an inherited WAGR deletion .
Wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases .
We have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene , homologous to the mouse Pax - 6 gene , is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13 , while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia - associated translocation breakpoints ( and hence a second candidate marker ) is present on both chromosomes .
These results support the Pax - 6 homologue as a strong candidate for the AN2 gene .
FISH with cosmid probes has proved to be a fast and reliable technique for the molecular analysis of deletions .
It can be used with limited amounts of material and has strong potential for clinical applications . .
Linkage of gene for C2 deficiency and the major histocompatibility complex MHC in man .
Family study of a further case .
Close linkage between HL - A and C2 deficiency was first reported by FU and co - workers in 1974 .
We present here a pedigree of a 31 - year - old C2 - deficient individual with clinical manifestations of Hodgkins disease .
The following markers were tested C2 levels , factor B polymorphism , blood groups , and enzyme typing .
In addition to close linkage between HL - A and C2 deficiency , both parents were heterozygous for Bf ( HL - A linked , electrophoretic variation of B ) .
The two HL - A haplotypes closely linked to C2 deficiency are different 2 , W18 and W24 , W18 .
They share , however , the SD2 antigen W18 and the LD type 7a . .
Screening for germ - line mutations in familial adenomatous polyposis patients : 61 new patients and a summary of 150 unrelated patients .
We report here the result of a screening for germ - line mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene in 61 new familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) patients as well as a summary of the results of 150 patients .
Examination of the entire coding region of the APC gene , based on a ribonuclease protection assay coupled with the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , disclosed mutations that were considered to cause significant defects in the APC product in 97 of 150 unrelated FAP patients .
Our findings revealed the following characteristics of the germ - line mutations of APC 1 ) the great majority of the mutations were found to truncate the APC product ; 2 ) almost all of the mutations were located within the first half of the coding region ; 3 ) no correlation was observed between the locations of germ - line mutations and extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients ; 4 ) more than 80 % of base substitutions in the APC gene were from cytosine to other nucleotides , nearly one - third of which occurred at the GpG site .
Our results provide information helpful to an understanding of the APC gene and will also contribute to presymptomatic diagnosis of members in FAP families . .
Somatic mutations of the APC gene in colorectal tumors : mutation cluster region in the APC gene .
We examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene in 63 colorectal tumors ( 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas ) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) and non - FAP patients .
In addition to loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) at the APC locus in 30 tumors , 43 other somatic mutations were detected .
Twenty - one of them were point mutations ; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations , and three occurred in introns at the splicing site .
Twenty - two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion ; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1 - bp insertion .
One tumor had a 1 - bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site .
Hence , 41 ( 95 % ) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein .
Over 60 % of the somatic mutations in the APC gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15 , designated as MCR ( mutation cluster region ) , which accounted for less than 10 % of the coding region .
Combining these data and the results of LOH , more than 80 % of tumors ( 14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas ) had at least one mutation in the APC gene , of which more than 60 % ( 9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas ) had two mutations .
These results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors . .
Constitutional mutations in the WT1 gene in patients with Denys - Drash syndrome .
The Denys - Drash syndrome is characterised by a typical nephropathy , genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of Wilms tumor .
These patients eventually go into end stage renal failure .
A candidate Wilms tumor gene , WT1 , from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned .
We have analysed the DNA sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them .
Four of the mutations were in exon 9 , all resulting in missense mutations .
Three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change .
The other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein .
One patient had a missense mutation in exon 8 , converting an arg > his .
A single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient .
We were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene .
The last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found .
There was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression .
These results further demonstrate that the WT1 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito - urinary system . .
Linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations : diastrophic dysplasia in Finland .
Linkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated populations provides a powerful tool for fine structure localization of disease genes .
Here , Luria and Delbrucks classical methods for analysing bacterial cultures are adapted to the study of human isolated founder populations in order to estimate ( i ) the recombination fraction between a disease locus and a marker ; ( ii ) the expected degree of allelic homogeneity in a population ; and ( iii ) the mutation rate of marker loci .
Using these methods , we report striking linkage disequilibrium for diastrophic dysplasia ( DTD ) in Finland indicating that the DTD gene should lie within 0 .
06 centimorgans ( or about 60 kilobases ) of the CSF1R gene .
Predictions about allelic homogeneity in Finland and mutation rates in simple sequence repeats are confirmed by independent observations .
The Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome : refinement of the localization on Xp and identification of another closely linked marker locus , OATL1 .
